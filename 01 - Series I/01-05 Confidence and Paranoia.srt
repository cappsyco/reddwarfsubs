This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,671
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,993
The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was
in suspended animation during the disaster

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,755
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold.

help pass the time if I

So? Clean my teeth, please, Holly.

You don't dream about

someone that you
don't feel something for.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,155
Lister, I once had a dream about a baboon.
It doesn't mean I want to go to bed with it.

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,596
- Must've meant something.
- Shave, please, Holly.

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,674
Lister, you ought to should take
a good long look at yourself,

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,879
then you'd see just how ridiculous
you appear to other people.

me, you wouldn't have these problems.

Come on, Rimmer, The only reason
you knocked around with those prats

86
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,240
from the Love Celibacy Society is
you could never get a date.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,473
No it wasn't. I happen to agree with
their philosophy that love is a sickness

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,349
that holds back your career and
makes you want to spend all your money.

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,671
And you could never get a date because you
let your mum buy all your "casual" clothes.

90
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,639
There's nothing wrong with my casual clothes.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,773
Oh, come on, Rimmer,
your trousers were so short

92
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:15,157
when you crossed your legs,
you could see your knees.

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,312
What about Yvonne McGruder?
That was a date.

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,474
She'd been hit on the head by a winch.
She had concussion.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,551
That's got nothing to do with it.
She was crazy about me.

96
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,235
- Oh yeah? She kept calling you Norman.
- She still went to bed with me.

97
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,631
Yeah, because she had wonky vision,
and she thought you were somebody else.

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,792
Serves her right for being
concussed, doesn't it?

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,599
Rimmer! You don't know what love is.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,913
Oh, Yes I do, Lister. Love is a device
invented by bank managers

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,071
to make us overdrawn.

Love is what makes us different from animals.

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,440
No, Lister, what makes us different from animals

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,718
is we don't use our tongues
to clean our own genitals.

107

has fainted. I cannot pick him up. Quick! Come now.

Is there something wrong with you?
Lister's collapsed!

152
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
- Yeah?
- What do you mean "yeah"?, he needs help!

153
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,076
- And?
- And if you don't help him, he might die.

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,994
Aw, no! That's too bad.
I really liked him, too.

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,357
- So, come and help him.
- What, and interrupt my lunch?!

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,478
What is more important, the
man's life or your smegging lunch?

157
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,313
That doesn't even deserve an answer.

158
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,638
Right. OK. Fine. You come with me.
You get a stretcher.

164
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,438
- Ah! My eye!
- Lister, they've got to learn.

165
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,115
- I've just nearly lost an eye!
- How about an anal reading?

166
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,431
- I'm alright, I feel fine now!
- Well, you're not fine.

167
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,727
And it's your own
smegging fault for going up to

168
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,957
the officers' deck before
it was decontaminated.

169
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,546
I just wanted to have a look around.

170
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,110
You just wanted to go into Kochanski's quarters
and wallow in self pity and look what's it got you.

171
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm alright, I've got a touch
of pneumonia, that's all.

172
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,958
It's not pneumonia. Three million
years ago, it was pneumonia.

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,707
Since then, it's bred and mutated
and now we don't know what it is.

174
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,830
Why didn't I ask her out?

175
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,116
What's the worst she could've said?

176
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,124
She could've said, "No, you're
a filthy, stinking, loathsome,

177
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,316
disgusting object I wouldn't be
seen dead with in a plague pit."

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,040
She could've said yes.
Stranger things have happened.

179
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,270
Only two spring to mind, Lister:

180
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,069
the spontaneous combustion
of the Mayor of Warsaw in 1546

181
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,677
and that incident in 12th-century
Burgundy when it rained herring.

182
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,888
There's this theory me
and Chen used to have.

183
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,840
It's like everyone's got
two people inside you

184
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,911
you've got your confidence
and your paranoia.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,208
Your confidence is the guy
who goes, "Hey, you're great.

186
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,834
you're dead sexy!
Everybody loves you!"

187
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,959
Your paranoia says, "You're stupid, useless,
you're ugly and everybody hates you."

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,352
That's odd, Lister. According
to this reading, you're clinically dead.

189
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,622
And what had happened was, my confidence
had just about persuaded me to ask

190
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:15,398
Kochanski out, and as I was walking up to her,
he'd go on a business trip to Hawaii or something

191
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,474
I'd be left with my paranoia, saying, "You
must be joking, She's gonna laugh in our face."

192
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,633
Sometimes, Lister, you can be quite
perceptive and thought-provoking.

193
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,032
Other times, like this, you rant
and drivel on like a complete loony.

194
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,235
- Just take me to me bed.
- All right, Lister.

195
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,952
OK, you now how it works.
Now, release the mechanism very, very, very gently.

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,596
Possibly a gnat's more gently than that.

197
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
Quick! Get an umbrella! Get an umbrella! Quick!

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
Get an umbrella! Get an umbrella!

199
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,678
Get an umbrella!

200
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,718
Get an umbrella!

201
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,998
Necrobics. Hologrammatic exercises for the dead.

202
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,959
It's raining! It's raining! Get an umbrella!

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,196
It's raining. It's raining...

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,830
Holly, what's going on?

205
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,513
- What?
- What's happening?

206
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,956
Um, Hercule Poirot's
Just stepped off the steaming train.

207
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,919
If you want my opinion, I think they all did it.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,542
Why do we have to have
you as the ship's computer?

209
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,837
We'd be better off with a bucket
full of sheep slop running things.

210
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,279
If you've got a complaint, just come straight out with it. Don't hide behind innuendo and hyperbole.

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
- Why is it raining fish in our sleeping quarters?!
- I'd be lying if I said I knew.

212
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,952
The only comparable incident on record
is in 12th-century Burgundy when it rained herring.

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,917
(BELL RINGS)

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,253
(MAYOR OF WARSAW EXPLODES)

215
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,549
It really is going to be one of those days, isn't it?

216
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,150
Hey, you're awake!

217
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,312
- Yeah, I just woke up.
- I've brought some presents!

218
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,075
- Oh, thanks, you shouldn't have bothered.
- Ahaha!, 'cause I'm that kinda guy!

219
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,551
Let's see what we've got
in the magic bag, here...

220
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,109
I got you some grapes,

221
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:02,071
- and I got you an orange.
- Oh, thanks a lot. I feel better already.

222
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,634
Well, all this enormous generosity
has made me tired. I'm going to bed.

223
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,511
Ah, yes, indeedy.

224
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,316
- You're awake.
- Yeah, but I'll be asleep in a minute.

225
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,557
How do you feel?

226
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:22,076
Fine, just don't ask me anymore
questions, I'm trying to sleep!

227
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,630
Shut up, you stupid
moggy and out of that bed!

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,998
Well, if you're gonna speak to me like that. I'm gonna take my presents back!

229
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,356
- How do you feel?
- Hurt!

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,080
- I feel great.
- Listen, Lister, you had a fever, OK?

231
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,152
- Yeah.
- And you started to hallucinate, alright?

232
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,598
- Yeah?
- Only your hallucinations... were solid.

233
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,071
- What do you mean 'solid'?
- I mean, they were real, alive, solid.

234
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,719
- Solid?
- Solid.

235
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,998
- What do you mean "They were solid"?!
- OK, I'll put it another way.

236
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,720
- You had hallucinations, all right?
- Yeah.

237
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,519
And they were solid.

238
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,594
I told you it wasn't ordinary pneumonia.
I told you it was mutated.

239
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,230
- I knew something like this would happen.
- OK, what did I hallucinate?

240
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,032
- Well, first of all, it was fish rain.
- Fish rain? Yeah, I dreamt that!

241
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,157
- Well, it actually happened.
- Where's all the fish?

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,231
Somebody ate them!

243
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,595
Then the Mayor of Warsaw
spontaneously combusted.

244
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,559
And then you hallucinated two men
in the Drive Room.

245
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,519
- What two men?
- Apparently, one of them's your confidence

246
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,273
and the other's your paranoia.

247
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,957
You see what I mean, Lister?

248
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,350
Hey! It's the king!

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,431
Mr Beautiful!

250
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,514
Hey, you what's the "H" for? Horace?
A chair for the king, Horace.

251
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,160
And breakfast. Mr Wonderful wishes to dine.

252
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,632
Have you lost weight? You're looking
great. Is he totally perfect or what?

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,509
- You're my confidence?
- I just love that accent. It makes me go all wibbly!

254
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,294
I don't understand it, you look
like the manager of the London Jets

255
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,278
But you sound like Bing
Baxter, the American quiz show host.

256
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,433
I'm all the things you associate
with confidence, King.

257
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,559
- And you're my paranoia?
- Isn't that a urine stain on the front of your trousers?

258
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,679
- What? No, it isn't. It's tea.
- So, how are you, anyway?

259
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,549
Isn't that a huge spot appearing
on your so-called face?

260
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,315
My God, you've got fat, haven't
you? Must be all that lager.

261
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,789
Bet you've got a terminal disease.

262
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,430
Always happens to people who
least expect it, don't you find that?

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,309
Say hello, then, won't you?
Only trying to be friendly.

264
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,233
Davey, baby, what can I say?

265
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,154
Is he the greatest, most handsome, fantastic person ever, or am I insane?

266
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,790
You're insane.
Lister, what are you going to do about them?

267
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,554
- Do? What can I do?
- I think we should arrest them.

268
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,678
- What for?
- For being hallucinations.

269
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,797
Come on, smeghead.
It's a bit of company isn't it?

270
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,871
Lister, you're still sick.

271
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,679
These two are symptoms of your disease.

272
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,116
They're like the spots in measles,
the swellings in mumps,

273
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,919
the funny walk in cystitis.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,833
Until they're gone, you won't be better.

275
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,314
Hey, now I know what the "H" stands for.
"Hidiot"! Am I right?

276
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,791
You are treading a very thin line, miladdo.

277
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,953
The "H" stands for "Hologram".
I happen to be dead.

278
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,919
Couldn't happen to a more deserving guy.

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,356
Come on, King.
Forget those losers. Let's go party.

280
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,317
- No, I forbid it!
- Why?

281
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,997
Why do you never listen to Mr Rimmer?
He's so much more experienced,

282
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,118
more level-headed,
so much... better than you.

283
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,987
Hey! No one is better than
Mr. Magnificent, and no one

284
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:45,798
tells the Prince of Charisma
what to do. Right, Prince?

285
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,394
- Yeah, right!
- That's my Davey-boy!

286
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,515
I don't believe it, he's socialising
with a figment of his imagination.

287
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,999
Yes.

288
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,559
Please note, the dust storm is approaching.
The ship exterior is now out of bounds.

289
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,553
All airlocks are being automatically sealed.

290
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,393
Estimated duration. 18 hours.

291
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,510
(OFF-KEY) # ..our love I tried to kindle

292
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,197
# like firelight, it...dwindled

293
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:24,279
# Now I wonder when this...wind'll
ever stop #

294
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,114
- You wrote that?
- Yeah, but it was ages ago, y'know...

295
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,034
- That is the greatest love song ever.
- Come on!

296
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,839
Ever! It's so deep. The images!

297
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,357
The dwindling, the kindling,
all the indling! I love all that stuff!

298
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,071
When I think there's fast-buck merchants
Like Bee-thoven and Mozart out there,

299
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,154
grabbing the publicity, and here's you,
writing pieces of that calibre,

300
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,231
it makes me wanna weep.

301
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,921
What are you doing
with the cigarette butt?

302
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,110
Oh, you've embarrassed me now.

303
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,593
It's just... your lips have touched it.
Your lips! The King's kissing lips!

304
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,880
I just wanted some proof that I'd
actually met the Duke of Deliciousness!

305
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,190
You're serious, aren't you?

306
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,999
- Serious about what?
- Look, I'm a nobody!

307
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,439
Out of 169 people aboard this ship,
I ranked 169. Bottom of the pile.

308
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,592
That's because you didn't want all that career stuff.

309
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,514
You wanted your farm on Fiji
with you-know-who.

310
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,591
- If she'd've come.
- If?!

311
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,117
And turn down the opportunity
of becoming the envy of all womankind?

312
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,272
- Oh, we'll never know now.
- Why not?

313
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,920
- She's dead.
- So? So is Rimmer, bring her back.

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,144
I can't. Holly can only
sustain one hologram,

315
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:43,312
and Rimmer's hidden all the
other personality disks.

316
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,040
- So? Find them.
- I can't.

317
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,193
King, you can do anything.

318
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,078
Anything!

319
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,911
- ..anything. He can't do anything.
- Oh, I know, I know. I'll bet five.

320
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,913
Do you know, he used to
practise kissing on his own.

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,038
- How?
- He made lips out of one hand,

322
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,909
then waggled his thumb
through the gap like a tongue.

323
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,150
That is priceless, it really is.

324
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,074
Seventeen years old and
he used to snog his own hand.

325
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,519
Once, in front of the whole school,
he called his gym teacher "Daddy".

326
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,750
I could've died with embarrassment.

327
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,229
Hahaha, what a silly thing to call a gym master...

328
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,135
I'm wracked with
guilt. I hate him!

329
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,156
If you hate him, why do
you talk about him so much?

330
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,120
Because he makes my life
one big, humiliating, cringe-making,

331
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,191
guilt-ridden hell!

332
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,999
Now! Stab him! Stab him!
Stab him! Quick! Stab him!

333
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,792
Ah, you haven't met Stabhim.
He's one of our skutters.

334
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,351
Stabhim, meet Lister's Paranoia.
Lister's Paranoia, this is Stabhim.

335
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,431
Yo, Rimmer listen, we've been thinking.

336
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,911
We think we can get Kochanski back
without turning you off.

337
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,231
Oh, he's drunk. Yes, I
can smell it from here!

338
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,553
All we gotta do is turn off all unnecessary
power systems, and Holly says it'll work.

339
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,838
Ding dong! Another great idea from the people
who brought you beer milkshakes!

340
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,799
How can you be so obsessed
with a girl you hardly know.

341
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,510
Hardly knows her?
You haven't heard the "indling" song!

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,991
- # Our love I tried to kindle... #
- Not now!

343
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,712
- Lister, you're not having her disk.
- Why? Because she'll rank above you?

344
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,271
But she's a bright, good-looking,
intelligent, witty, upwardly mobile officer.

345
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,670
Why should she be interested in you?

346
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,390
- Yes, why should she be interested in you?
- Yeah, should she be interested in me?

347
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,836
Hmm? Sorry, I was just thinking
about that song.

348
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,437
I can't get it out of my head.
Why? Because you're great!

349
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,558
You're an incredibly seductive,
charming, charismatic young stud!

350
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,439
Yeah, I forgot. That's why
she'd be interested in me.

351
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,273
Lister, you're not having
her disk or any disk.

352
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,398
Come on, King. You know
Rimmer, where would he hide 'em?

353
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,869
- I dunno.
- Yes, you do.

354
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,749
- No, he doesn't.
- Come on, think "winner".

355
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,750
Outside. Outside the ship.

356
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,355
- Er, wrong, actually!
- Where outside?

357
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,671
Well, he'd have to send the skutters,
and the disks would have to be safe...

358
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,037
Wrong, wrong! Absolutely brimming
over with wrongability.

359
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,432
And they'd have to be right under
my nose, so he could laugh at me.

360
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,080
Wrong and getting wronger all the time.

361
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,549
Outside our sleeping quarters.

362
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,393
The solar panel outside our sleeping quarters?

363
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,074
You followed me, you goit!

364
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,999
Is that where they are?! That's incredible! I did it!

365
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,758
Lister?

366
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,273
- How long now, Hol?
- Can't be long now, Dave.

367
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,829
Hercule has got all the suspects in one room,

368
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,038
and I'm only two pages from "also by the same author".

369
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,316
No, Holly. The dust storm.

370
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,711
Oh, that
Any time now, it's almost subsided.

371
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,715
Hey, how's my baby boy? Oh look!
You've got a body like a coat hanger!

372
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,713
How can you make a spacesuit look like eveningwear?

373
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,112
- Let me ask you one question?
- It's no use arguing, Rimmer, I'm going.

374
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,955
- Who smashed up the medicomp?
- He's stalling, King. Let's go.

375
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,475
Holly, give him a punch up.

376
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,234
Look, what's in it for them
smashing up the medical unit?

377
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,438
Lister, come here. Come here.

378
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,471
You are still sick.

379
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,836
- I feel great.
- You will not...

380
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,831
You will not...

381
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,550
You will not be better until they've gone.

382
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,395
They know that, and now they've
stopped you getting any treatment.

383
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,911
Where's Paranoia?

384
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,231
I don't know. Is it some place near Uruguay?

385
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,311
Who is this joker?

386
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,189
- Lister, they're germs and they're dangerous.
- The storm has passed, Dave.

387
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,717
- Airlocks are now released,
- What are we waiting for, King?

388
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,598
Nothing.

389
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,998
- Holly, put a trace on Paranoia.
- What's a trace?

390
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,064
It's space jargon.
It means 'find him'.

391
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,756
No it doesn't. You just
made it up to be cool.

392
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,837
- Where is he?
- Paranoia is no longer aboard this ship.

393
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,396
(CONFIDENCE) Look at that view, Kingo!

394
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,996

- Nope.

In space, no one can
hear you cha-cha-cha!

00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:51,116
You don't think maybe Paranoia
could've got here first do you?

404
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,158
- Forget him, he's no danger.
- He smashed up the medical unit.

405
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,336
- No, he didn't. - What do you mean?
- I did! - You did?

406
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,719
So we can be together, Davey. You
don't wanna get cured. I did it for you!

407
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,360
- So, where did he go, then?
- I killed him. Cha-cha-cha...

408
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,000
What do you mean, you killed him, cha-cha-cha?!

409
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,159
Hey, don't look at me
like that, he didn't suffer.

410
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:11,517
I just fed him into the waste grinder

411
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,069
and flushed his mince into space.

412
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,073
Look, I-I'm gonna go inside now.

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,357
Gets a little bit hot. I get a little
bit claustrophobic in these suits.

414
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,290
- Take your helmet off.
- What?!

415
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,284
- Go ahead, take your helmet off!
- I'll die

416
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:25,911
- Why?
- There's no oxygen out here!

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,312
- Hey, oxygen's for losers. Come on!
- I need oxygen!

418
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,030
You don't need anything, King. You're the king!

419
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,272
- You're crazy!
- Who told you you needed oxygen, huh?

420
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,591
Some loser who was trying to make you feel small.

421
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,355
Look, I'll prove it to you. I'll take mine off first.

422
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,478
- We'll see who's the crazy one around here!
- No!

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,431
- It's totally disgusting.
- What's disgusting?

426
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,431
- Lister?
- Yeah?

427
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,638
I just want to say I was right all along.

428
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,340
I said they were germs
and they were germs.

429
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,793
Yeah, OK. So what?

430
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,396
And I'm just saying now, that
disk will only bring you misery.

431
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,710
I just want you to
remember that I said that.

432
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,237
Look, if she comes back and
she's not interested, I can handle it.

433
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,791
Whatever, Lister. I want it on record. That
disk is a one-way ticket to Miseryville.

434
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,838
Yeah, well I've spent enough
time listening to me paranoia.
