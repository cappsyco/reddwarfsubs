00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,480
Kryten, it's me. Are you there?

2
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,240
KRYTEN: Er, yes, sir, I'm here, sir,
reading you. Over.

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,080
There's something on Little Monitor 2.
Weird shape. Really massive. What is it?

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,960
It's your kebab, sir, as requested. Over.

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,000
What, this is a kebab?!

6
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,040
Wow! It's absolutely massive!
It's a monster!

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,280
A large chicken doner combo, salad,
chilli sauce, everything. Over.

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,560
All right, I'm going in!

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,600
Good luck, sir!

No way!

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,040
What's that smell?
Has there been a fire in here?

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,800
Just a small one.
I put it out with my beer.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
For goodness' sake, Lister,
that's terrible!

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,800
Don't panic! I've got another one.

You can't eat in the drive room.

Health and Safety Protocol 121.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Who cares about health and safety,
Rimmer?

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,040
We're getting life signs from this moon,
200 clicks east. I'm gonna check it out!

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
Lister, we have health and safety
protocols for a reason -

25
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,840
to safeguard the crew.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,880
What crew?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,440
The original crew?
They all got wiped out, remember?

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
- Exactly.
- By you!

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
Exactly.

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,760
When you didn't fix
that drive plate properly,

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,960
and that radiation leak
fried them to a crisp.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,400
Exactly.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Which is why the whole health and safety
protocol procedure has been updated.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Because, ultimately, who was truly
to blame for that accident?

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,000
The man... or the system?

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,240
The man.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,960
Was it the man, though?

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
It was, yes.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Or was it the system?

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,760
It was the man, definitely the man.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
Or was it the system?

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
The man.

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
A system that allowed a technician
to repair a drive plate

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,520
without adequate training or know-how.

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,600
A system that has since been completely
overhauled by yours truly,

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
so that an accident of that nature
never happens again.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
So what you're saying is,

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
you learned valuable safety lessons from
wiping out the crew and, as a result,

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
you've updated the safety regulations,

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,520
making this ship a much safer
working environment

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
for the crew you wiped out.

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,760
Scoff away, Lister, but the point is
we have new regulations,

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
which means that
you're going to have to fill in

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
an accident report form for that fire.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,280
- A what?!
- And once it's completed,

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
you'll have to submit it
to the Accident Report Assessment Unit,

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,160
care of the Health and Safety Executive.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
And who the smeg would that be?

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Me.

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
There are the forms.

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,280
I am not filling out any smegging forms,
Rimmer!

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm going to check this moon.

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,600
Ignore that, and someone
could get seriously hurt.

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Yeah - you, if you keep talking!

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,760
Hang on a minute! It's 20 pages!

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,040
I'll send you on the other sections later.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
You're up late, sir.

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
Been hunting.

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,360
Trying to swat this damn space weevil.

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,880
Little sucker keeps outsmarting me!

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,560
Well, they do have an IQ of 2, sir.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
One minute it's there, next minute
it's gone. It's driving me crazy!

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
- What's happening with you?
- Well, I've been running some tests

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,360
on the crystals I extracted
from the quantum rod, sir.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,440
A by-product of the rod's ability
to transport its host vessel

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,360
seems to be a curious power
of synchronicity.

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,760
That's strange. Before, I was napping,

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
and I had a dream you were
doing something crazy with crystals.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,760
BOTH: What a weird coincidence.

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,760
BOTH: Hey! We both said that
at the same time!

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,840
BOTH: And that!

83
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,480
BOTH: What's going on?!

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
BOTH: Why are we saying
everything together?!

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
BOTH: Probably just coincidence.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,280
I think that's fixed it, sir.

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,760
You think that tube thing
made us speak at the same time?

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
I doubt it, sir.

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,840
BOTH: Probably just coincidence.

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,840
What the hell's going on?!

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
Well, it seems the crystals,
temporarily at least,

92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,360
have invigorated our psi,
making us more prone to coincidence.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,880
There was a fascinating book
on the subject

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,800
by a scientist called Arthur Koestler
which was called The Roots Of Coincidence.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
Here it is!

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
How weird is that?!

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
According to Koestler,
coincidence is more likely to happen

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
to people in states of heightened emotion,

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,320
as emotions lower consciousness while
increasing the power of the unconscious.

100
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
So, every time we're together
and emotional,

101
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
we're likely to experience
this coincidence stuff?

102
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Only temporarily, sir.

103
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,560
BOTH: Space weevil!

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,480
Mr Lister, some rather intriguing
developments on the, er...

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh.

106
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Mr Lister?

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
Well...

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Kryten!

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,280
Open the door!

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,320
I've left my key!

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
Open the door!

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,080
Let me in!

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
Sir, what on earth
were you doing outside?!

114
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,000
Trying to get in! Wasn't it obvious?

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
We've had a life sign confirmation
from one of the scouters.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,600
I took Starbug to check it out.

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,280
That's the second moon with life signs
we've passed in the last decade!

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
I had no idea this region of space
was so lively.

119
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah, it's mental round here, Kryten,
you never get a moment's peace(!)

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,640
Anyway, they're called BEGGs,
Biologically Engineered Garbage Gobblers,

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,120
created on Earth to eat refuse.
They've got this digestive system

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
that can cope with scoffing sediment,
sludge and slop,

123
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,720
permanently inebriated, with
breath that could sandblast buildings.

124
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm so pleased for you, sir.

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,400
At last you've got the opportunity
to make new friends.

126
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,360
I wanted to see if they'd help
in finding Kochanski.

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Did they, sir?

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
Nah, they've not seen her.

129
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Just spent the whole evening
drinking whisky and playing poker.

130
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
Anyway...

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Incidentally, sir, why were you outside
with a jet-pack?

132
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,240
Let me finish.

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,920
- As I was saying...
- Sir, where is Starbug?

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Let me finish! As I was saying,
we were sat round the...

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,920
Sir! You lost Starbug in a card game?!

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,880
You've spoilt the end now!

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't look at me like that.
There is an up side.

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
Up side, how can there be an up side?
What's the up side?

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,520
I lost Rimmer too.

140
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Pick him up Friday.

141
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
That's tomorrow! Oh, sir,
what on earth are we going to do?

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,040
I know. 24 hours - it's going to be worse
than being a kid on Christmas Eve.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,040
Oh, all right, all right. I'll go back
tomorrow, get him back somehow.

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Starbug too.

145
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,320
Speaking of Mr Rimmer,

146
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,960
he asked me to give you these
accident report forms for you to fill in.

147
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
Oh, cheers, Krytes.

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,320
Good night.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Just drying the cutlery, sir,
using my heat outlet.

151
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Kryten, where's Lister? Have you seen him?

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
I think he may be in the drive room, sir.

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Has he had an opportunity
to talk to you yet, sir?

154
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
- Why?
- No reason, sir, I was just wondering.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,160
Do you know if he's completed that sheaf
of health and safety forms yet?

156
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,160
I think he may need another set, sir.

157
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,160
You see, there was a slight accident
with the airlock,

158
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,640
and the papers were accidentally
sucked out into space, sir.

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Another accident?

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,040
That means he's going to have to fill out
two sets of accident report forms.

161
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll get the papers.

162
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,840
Well, it wasn't an accident per se, sir.

163
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,600
You mean he just flushed them out
into space?

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,960
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly like that,
Sir...

165
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
Were safety procedures followed?

166
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,760
Was an airlock accident
risk assessment form completed

167
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
before he opened the airlock?

168
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,720
That may have been overlooked, sir.

169
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,760
Well, that's another set of forms
he's going to have to fill in.

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
I don't know whether I've got enough.

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
He's not going to get away with this.

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,680
There's got to be a solution to this.

176
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,040
I've just been speaking to Kryten,
and he told me what you did.

177
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,920
- Did he?
- I have to say, I'm disappointed,

178
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
but not the least bit surprised.

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Right.

180
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,440
Well, you're taking it better
than I expected.

181
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
Expect people to let you down -
you'll never be disappointed.

182
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,320
Let me say right off that I'm truly sorry,
I really am.

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,320
- You're not sorry.
- Of course I'm sorry!

184
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,800
I've been up all night thinking about it.
I can't sleep!

185
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,240
Are you serious?

186
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
Of course I'm serious!
What I did was out of order, out of line.

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,640
Beyond the pale.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,520
Wow.

189
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,000
And just let me say, I'll put everything
to rights first thing in the morning.

190
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,640
I promise.

191
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,080
Finally, after all these years
of battering my head against a wall,

192
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,720
trying to make you into a person
of calibre and stature,

193
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,280
who takes pride in the mundane and petty,

194
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
at last the penny's dropped.

195
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,778
Listy, I have to say,

196
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:08,520
I think you're finally become the vending
machine third technician of my dreams!

197
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
What's this?

198
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
The accident report forms.

199
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,640
I haven't got time to waste
twatting about with that!

200
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
What?!

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,320
I've got to dig myself out of this hole
I've got myself into.

202
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,640
Hole, what hole?

203
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
The gambling with BEGGs hole.

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Gambling with BEGGs?

205
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
You've been gambling with BEGGs?!

206
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,160
Those garbage-munchers!

207
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Lister, I've told you a million times -

208
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,440
you gamble with lowlifes,
there's only one loser.

209
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
In this case, there's two!

210
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Who's the other one?

211
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
The guy about your height, your colouring,
who goes by the name of you.

212
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,680
Er, Mr Lister gambled you in a poker game,
Sir,

213
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,920
and I'm afraid to report, he lost you.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
We're all deeply sorry, bud.

215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,920
Apart from me and him and him.

216
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
Do you really think this is helping?

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm not here to help!

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Read my CV.

219
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,400
"Does not help. Does not clean.
Will have sex with anything."

220
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,360
You lost me in a poker game?!

221
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,960
Like I'm some kind of thing
to be lost in a poker game?!

222
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,640
I was trying to win Starbug back.

223
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
I didn't have anything else they wanted.

224
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,160
Right. Turn the engines up full power.
We'll outrun them.

225
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,520
Once they realise they can't catch us,
they'll give up.

226
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,680
- Ah, we can't outrun them.
- Why not?

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
(BLEEPING)

228
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Wow! Cool pants, bud!

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,480
Oh, that's a groin exploder, sir.

230
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
It sure is!

231
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,640
That's going to drive the chicks nuts!

232
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,120
If I don't make good on my debt -

233
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
deliver Rimmer by midnight tomorrow -

234
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,360
then this thing
is going to propel my love spuds

235
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
to the far reaches of deep space.

236
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
So what? You never used them anyway!

237
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,720
Have you tried removing it, sir?

238
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,720
It's rigged to blow if I tamper with it.

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
There's a sign on the side - "E-R-R-A".

240
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,160
ERRA?

241
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,920
Must be something to do with
the manufacturer, but I can't trace them.

242
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,320
I have to say I'm taking no pleasure
from this.

243
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
No pleasure whatsoever.

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,160
No, wait.
In fact, that's completely wrong.

245
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm taking immense pleasure from this.

246
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,120
It may not have occurred, sir, but if
the exploder detonates, killing Mr Lister,

247
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,400
then the ship will automatically shut down
your hologrammatic projection unit.

248
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,200
If Mr Lister goes, you go with him.

249
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,560
You're both sort of... connected.

250
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Like we are!

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,600
BOTH: What a coincidence!

252
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
A thought occurs, sir.

253
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,040
This technology is way beyond anything
the BEGGs could manufacture.

254
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,200
They have a low cunning but are
a primitive race of little sophistication.

255
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,680
Maybe that's our answer.

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,680
Weh fora bor kas ming! Ha-ha-ha!

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
He says, "Ah, so, you return
with my winnings! Ha-ha-ha!"

258
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,880
And in keeping with our agreement,
you deactivate the knacker attacker, yeah?

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,560
(LAUGHTER)

260
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,840
Buk afing?

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
Is that the hologram?

262
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,440
(WHIMPERS)

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,360
Yes, it is, but as you can see, he's old
and raddled and fit for nothing.

264
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,400
Skrom gella!

265
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
Fum, ollogun

266
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Chalaga 'raddled' monblaga Drogoh.

267
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,160
Instead, I bring you this.

268
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,360
Ogah la kragumo, hjoon!

269
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,080
The fabled...

270
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,400
spoon of destiny.

271
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,320
He that hath the spoon
controls all things.

272
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
No object hath such power.

273
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,840
Umba la skrom dru

274
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,040
Yn-jalla yelo 'controls' trala lumo, droboh!

275
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,480
Heswa gzentu mo?

276
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,360
He says, if the spoon controls all things,
why are you trading it?

277
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,640
Um...

278
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Well, we just don't... really... use it much
any more.

279
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,000
And, um...

280
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,400
It's a good question.

281
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,400
We prefer the ship of green
and a sexy light man

282
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,240
with the lady legs so long and luscious.

283
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,920
He speaks English!

284
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
Lobogo rogu bilen... er...

285
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,520
'English boarding school' Bilang aroo.

286
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,400
What, he went
to an English boarding school?

287
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,000
Ah, no, sir, he ate someone
from an English boarding school.

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,320
He forced them to teach him English
and then he munched them whole.

289
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,280
If it pleases,
maybe we will play cards again.

290
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Then perhaps you will win back
your hologram and your ship of green.

291
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Or maybe you will lose.
And, if you do, we will take your droid!

292
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,040
And your scented, shiny friend too.

293
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,240
(LAUGHTER)

294
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,560
Look, we've got nothing to lose.

295
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,960
Let's play.

296
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,920
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

297
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
KRYTEN AND CAT:
I have a bad feeling about this.

298
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,280
I've got this one, Krytes.

299
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,680
Sir, you're being set up again.
Don't you see?

300
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,720
They're not simple people,
they're every bit as smart as you or I!

301
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,160
Yeah, I was close the last time,
I just got a bit cocky!

302
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,200
You choked! You always choke!

303
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
You can't handle the pressure, bud.

304
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,840
If anyone's going to choke, they'll choke.

305
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,320
- BOTH: They'll choke?!
- Yeah, they're the chokers.

306
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,360
BOTH: They're not going to choke.

307
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,960
- (THEY COUGH)
- They're choking!

308
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Don't choke! How do you get out of this?

309
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Don't die!
How do you get out of the exploder?

310
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,960
(CHOKING)

311
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,640
What's he saying, Kryten?

312
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,520
He's speaking Choking To Death, sir.

313
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,480
It's very hard to translate
if you're not being strangled.

314
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
Don't die, don't die!

315
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,960
Argh!

316
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,280
Argh! The only guys that can help me get
out of this thing and now they're dead!

317
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,200
What am I going to do now?!

318
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
(WIND WHISTLES)

319
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,080
Let me get this right.

320
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,320
You guys have become...
quantum entangled somehow?

321
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
BOTH: Exactly.

322
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,880
So you killed them?

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,360
Oh, that event was always going to occur.

324
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,120
It's just, with our heightened emotions,
we were more aware of the synchronicity.

325
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
Who cares?! What am I going to do now?

326
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,080
Perhaps we can harness
our new-found powers to help, sir.

327
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,560
How?

328
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,520
Well, Koestler said intense emotional
states tend to drive coincidence.

329
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,280
So you're saying
we need to make you two emotional?

330
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
- Precisely.
- Getting me emotional?

331
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,080
That's going to be harder than you think.

332
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,280
Ever heard of the expression
"as cool as a Cat"?

333
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,440
We're pretty hard to fluster, buddy.

334
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,680
(SNIPPING)

335
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,280
Stage one achieved.

336
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,680
What do we do now?

337
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
RIMMER: Who turned that on?

338
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
He's in danger, isn't he?

339
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Oh, darling. Can't we help him?

340
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
He's got to get to the station.
It's his only chance.

341
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
But there's so little time!

342
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,680
- Station?
- Maybe some space station.

343
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
It's up to him now.

344
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,720
His fate is...

345
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
written in the stars.

346
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,640
Maybe the stars
are something to do with this?

347
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
KRYTEN: It's that book again.

348
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
BOTH: I'm not even going to say it.

349
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
Look! Stars.

350
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,000
And numbers.

351
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,400
2-5-2-3-1-1.

352
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,640
BOTH: Those sound like space coordinates.

353
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,280
That's getting really annoying.

354
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,680
BOTH: That's what E-R-R-A is.
It's a space station!

355
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,560
Maybe the device was manufactured
on the space station

356
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,360
and ended up on this moon somehow!

357
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,920
Let's punch these numbers into the
Navicomp and see where it takes us.

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,760
CAT: So what is that place?

359
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,680
It's the Erroneous Reasoning
Research Academy, sir,

360
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
or ERRA, for short.

361
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,960
Erroneous reasoning? What's that?

362
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
Most of the great scientific breakthroughs

363
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,440
come when two theories
previously dismissed as wrong

364
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
are combined to make a right.

365
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,480
The DNA double helix
was discovered in this exact way.

366
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
What did they do here?

367
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,880
Well, they specialised in wrongness, sir.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,760
wrongness?!

369
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,800
The staff were hand-picked
for their ability to be mistaken,

370
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,560
for their gifts in fallacious analysis
and defective reasoning.

371
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,520
You could've excelled here!

372
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,720
They were all outstandingly good
at being consistently incorrect.

373
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,440
There were a lot of referees, TV critics,
weathermen...

374
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,360
...who were then re-educated
in the sciences

375
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,640
to develop extraordinary new
erroneous theories

376
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,240
that would be combined together
to produce works of great genius.

377
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,280
Did it work?

378
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
No.

379
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,920
The whole idea turned out to be wrong.

380
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,560
The man behind the idea was so
depressed, he attempted suicide.

381
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,320
Naturally, he failed
and he went on to live into his 90s.

382
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,960
Look, we know the device
was manufactured here.

383
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,560
The key to getting out of this
has got to be here somewhere.

384
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,480
- (BLEEPING)
- Locking on to the mainframe.

385
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, interesting.

386
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,560
There appears to be some kind of life form
in stasis.

387
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,280
Maybe we can ask their advice!

388
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,920
Top floor.

389
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,360
I pressed top floor.
How come we're going down?

390
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,800
I'll press down.

391
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,320
(BLEEP)

392
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,360
CAT: Now we're going up!

393
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,960
Everything is wrong here!

394
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,160
I don't think you're right, Kryten.

395
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
I assure you I am, sir.

396
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,040
No. I like this place.

397
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,840
I'm very comfortable here.

398
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,880
The smell, the atmosphere.
It feels like...home.

399
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,320
(DING!)

400
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,960
The stasis booths are in there.

401
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,360
How the hell do we get in?

402
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,600
Pity none of us can walk through walls!

403
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
Oh, well, one of us can!

404
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,480
Mr Rimmer, if he switches
to soft light projection mode.

405
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,920
Then, once I'm in, change back
to hard light projection mode.

406
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,280
Highly likely there'll be a switch
to open the door from inside the vault.

407
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,080
Whatever. Can you just make it quick?
Cos this is getting hotter.

408
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm getting baked potatoes!

409
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,080
It sounds like it's getting ready to blow.
Come on.

410
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,120
(BLEEP)

411
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,760
Can you read me, sir?

412
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,160
Switching you over now.

413
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,920
(BLEEPING)

414
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,160
RIMMER: Back to hard light, over.

415
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,600
See anything?

416
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,840
Eyes adjusting, walking along... Wait.

417
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
Stasis booths, banks of them.

418
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,680
Anything?

419
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,840
There's a light on in one of the booths.

420
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,600
Whatever it is, it's alive.

421
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,520
According to the read-outs, female,
aged 31.

422
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
Kochanski's female.

423
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,480
Kochanski's 31!

424
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
Is it Kochanski?

425
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,280
Whoever it is, they're brunette, 5 '5 ".

426
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,000
Kochanski's brunette. Kochanski's 5'5"!

427
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Is it Kochanski?

428
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Start pod deactivation sequence.

429
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Getting ID info.

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,640
Give me two minutes. Going offline.

431
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh, it won't be her.
It'll be someone else. It won't be her.

432
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,120
I know it's not her. Don't even think for
one second that I think that it's her,

433
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,680
because I know it isn't, I know it.

434
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
- Say it is...
- Do you think it might be?

435
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,960
Do you think it's got something
to do with this coincidence thing?

436
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,920
BOTH: Could be!

437
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
(WHIRRING)

438
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,400
- The door's opening!
- Here we go.

439
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,680
It's not Kochanski. It won't be Kochanski.

440
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,080
It won't be Kochanski.

441
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,840
Gentlemen. Meet Professor Edgington,

442
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,600
head of the ERRA Institute
and inventor of the groinal exploder.

443
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,080
Well, it's definitely not Kochanski.

444
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,640
She went for my groin.

445
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,120
Most fascinating. She was working on
a research programme into evolution,

446
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,640
attempting to evolve into the next species
of the evolutionary ladder.

447
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,960
Naturally, the professor,
as a gifted ERRA-pert,

448
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,680
got the experiment totally wrong.

449
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,040
So basically, she took an evolutionary
wrong turn and wound up a monkey?

450
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
She should've stopped
and asked directions!

451
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,480
Much as I'm enjoying this chitchat, it
ain't helping me get this ball-buster off.

452
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,640
I believe it is, sir.

453
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,000
This is the very machine Professor
Edgington carried out her operation with.

454
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,360
Now, if we can evolve her
back to her human form,

455
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
she may be able to help us.

456
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I've studied the manual,
it seems quite straightforward.

457
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm amazed she got it so wrong!

458
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,360
- Come on, let's go, switch it on.
- Turning on now, sir.

459
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
Pressing "undo" now.

460
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,520
Evolution mode...engaged.

461
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,280
(HOOTS)

462
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,520
Oh, smeg! She's human.

463
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,760
Oh, smeg!
She's naked.

464
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,320
She's also naked.

465
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,000
- Did anyone mention that yet?
- Is she naked?

466
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
Oh, yes! I didn't notice.

467
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,160
I'll go and get her a sheet immediately.

468
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,480
No rush, Kryten.

469
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
Remember Protocol 175 -

470
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,760
no running in the corridors.

471
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,120
Take your time.

472
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,640
Walk carefully.

473
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Forget about the lift, Kryten,
take the stairs... one at a time.

474
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
He's just going to be a few minutes.

475
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,440
What are you doing, Lister?

476
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
Allow me to introduce you to the crew,
Professor Edgington.

477
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Oh, please, call me Irene...
or Professor E.

478
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,040
This is Mr Rimmer.

479
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,600
Mr Rimmer!

480
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,320
I sense a special bond between us.

481
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,520
I've always been attracted
to the brave, silent types.

482
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,680
That's me, all right!

483
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,680
I probably won't speak again for hours,

484
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,440
as I'll be off silently doing something
very brave.

485
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,040
What a gorgeous bunk room.

486
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
It's utterly enchanting.

487
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Enchanting?!

488
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
Oh!

489
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,520
- Who plays the trumpet?
- Trumpet?

490
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,160
It's a guitar case.

491
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,320
- Do any of you play?
- Yeah, I play.

492
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,760
I bet you're absolutely brilliant.

493
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,080
I thought she was supposed to be
wrong about everything, Kryten.

494
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Moving on to the matter in hand...

495
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,400
Yeah, yeah, can you...help me
get out of this?

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,040
There it is.

497
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,800
It's a diagram.

498
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,960
Five symbols. We have to turn
them off in the correct order.

499
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,360
What happens if we choose the wrong ones?

500
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
Absolutely nothing.
It's all perfectly safe.

501
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, God...

502
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,480
Right, if you're going to explode,
it's not going to be in here.

503
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Oh, Protocol 121 -
no exploding in the drive room, right(?)

504
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,560
Sir, perhaps best
if you stand in the corridor.

505
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,880
Don't mess this up.
I'm relying on you, Kryten.

506
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,280
Don't listen to a word she says.

507
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,000
Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta.

508
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,000
OK, ma'am, what's the first one
we turn off?

509
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,960
Beta.

510
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,240
Beta it is.

511
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,840
No...

512
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,600
alpha. No, beta.

513
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
Beta or alpha.

514
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,240
Or delta.

515
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
No, it's definitely delta.

516
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
Delta or gamma.

517
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,200
The only one Professor E
hasn't mentioned is theta.

518
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,280
First one - here it comes, sir - theta.

519
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Next one - gamma.

520
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,720
Definitely gamma, trust me.

521
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,160
- Any other possibilities?
- No...

522
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,320
No, gamma.
It's definitely gamma.

523
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,400
Just gamma.
I'm certain it's gamma.

524
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
Or maybe beta or alpha.

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,200
Next one, sir, here we go - delta.

526
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,800
Next - alpha, beta or gamma?

527
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Beta.

528
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
Or gamma.

529
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Or beta.

530
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
Alpha!

531
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,680
(SIGHS)

532
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,880
Two more, sir, then we're there.

533
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
Two more?
My boots are full of my own leg dribble.

534
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
- Professor?
- Call me Irene...everyone does.

535
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,040
Next wire - gamma or beta, ma'am?

536
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,800
Beta, it's definitely beta.

537
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm not going to change my mind this time.

538
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,280
- Beta.
- Beta.

539
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,320
- Beta.
- OK, gamma it is. Go for it.

540
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,640
BOTH: Wait a minute,
how about this for weird?

541
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,840
Her name's Irene
and her nickname is Professor E.

542
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,800
Put those names together
and you get Irene E.

543
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,160
Irony.

544
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Wouldn't it be ironic

545
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,560
if a professor known for being wrong
finally got something right?

546
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,600
What do we do?

547
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,480
Go for it.
Go for beta. Go for what she said.

548
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,400
(SIGHS)

549
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,480
(THEY LAUGH)

550
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,920
Oh, Arnold, you're everything
I want in a man - kind, clever, selfless.

551
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,520
Don't forget amazing!

552
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Can I ask you a question?

553
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,920
Do you think it would be wrong for us

554
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,920
to make love
on our very first evening together?

555
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,480
Hmm, let me think.

556
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,560
Well, Irene, on reflection,

557
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
and I've given this much thought,

558
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,720
I don't think it would.

559
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,960
In fact, I think it would be absolutely
fine, tickety-boo and peachy.

560
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,600
- (CLATTER)
- Hiya.

561
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
Come on.

562
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,400
- Don't touch the buttons!
- Don't touch the buttons!

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,280
- Don't...!
- (AIR HISSES)

564
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,760
Oh...

565
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,280
Oh...

566
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,440
Have you got a pen?

567
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,080
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

568
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,440
# I'm all alone, more or less

569
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,640
# Let me fly far away from here

570
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,720
# Fun, fun, fun

571
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,240
# In the sun, sun, sun

572
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,720
# I want to lie
Shipwrecked and comatose

573
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,880
# Drinking fresh mango juice

574
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,520
# Goldfish shoals nibbling on my toes

575
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,200
# Fun, fun, fun

576
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,840
# In the sun, sun, sun

577
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,880
# Fun, fun, fun

578
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,520
# In the sun, sun, sun. #

579
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,920
(EXPLOSION)
