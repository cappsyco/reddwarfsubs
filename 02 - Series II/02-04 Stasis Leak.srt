00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,673
(DRAMATIC "2001"-TYPE MUSIC)

2
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,354
Three million years from Earth,
the mining ship Red Dwarf.

3
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,796
Its crew: Dave Lister, the last human alive,

4
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,872
Arnold Rimmer,
a hologram of his dead bunkmate,

5
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,715
and a creature who evolved
from the ship's cat. Message ends.

6
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,874
Additional: on our journey back to Earth,

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,713
we have encountered many strange and bizarre things.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,239
Only last month, we came across a moon which
was shaped like Felicity Kendal's bottom.

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,359
We flew around that one a couple of times.

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,558
OK.

11
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,351
Rimmer, make this quick.

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,513
Sir, I wish to place on record that Third Technician Lister, David...

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,746
Quicker than that, Rimmer...

14
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,275
..smuggled aboard the mining
vessel Red Dwarf a consignment

15
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,273
of the hallucinogenic fungi Titan mushrooms,

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,560
more popularly known to the space
beatnik community as "freaky fungus".

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,995
- Is this true?
- Erm. Sort of.

18
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,947
...and on the morning of February
the 26th at 0800 hours

19
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:13,235
did engage in conversation with
Second Technician Rimmer, Arnold J...

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,682
For crying out loud, Rimmer!

21
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:18,030
The outcome of which was a
proposal by the aforementioned Lister

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,509
to the aforementioned Rimmer to cook him breakfast.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,356
- OK, I'm getting the picture.
- Breakfast comprised of two eggs, three rashers of bacon,

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,454
a grilled tomato, two sausages, a small portion of
fried potatoes and a large quantity of mushrooms.

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,831
Having consumed this repast,

26
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,196
Second Technician Rimmer, Arnold J, experienced

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,434
what can only be described
as a voyage to trip-out city.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,080
To wit, a major hallucinogenic fit.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,596
- Lister, is this true?
- No, sir.

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,671
I'm sure it was only one egg.

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,873
The aforementioned Rimmer, to wit, me,
then attended inspection parade.

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,749
He was totally naked,
except for a pair of mock leather driving gloves

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,831
and some blue swimming goggles.

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,620
Under the influence of this psychedelic breakfast,
he went on to attack two senior officers,

35
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,590
believing them to be giraffes
who were armed and dangerous.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,038
- You'd better have a good reason for this, Lister.
- I have, sir.

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,511
- Why'd you do it?
- I thought it'd be a laugh.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,592
Right. Two weeks PD, Lister. Dismissed.

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,390
With respect, sir, the penalty
for a crime of this nature is 15 years' imprisonment.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,756
- Thanks a lot!
- Rimmer, I said dismissed.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,956
- Two weeks?!
- That's enough.

42
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,351
- Two smegging weeks?!
- I said that is enough!

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,999
With respect, sir, you've got your head right
up your big, fat arse.

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,772
Eight weeks PD! How come I get
eight weeks, you get only two?

45
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:46,160
What did I do to deserve
that? What did I do?

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,269
- You shouldn't have stuck your pencil up his nose.
- It was the rubber end. Plus the doctor will get it out in no time.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,476
You ripped up and ate his wife's photograph.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,633
I didn't know it was his wife.
I thought it was a publicity shot from Planet Of The Apes.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,759
- Two teas.
- (MAN) Excuse me.

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,673
Listen, man, I'm sorry about those mushrooms, y'know?

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,832
I mean, I didn't know. I'm not totally reckless and irresponsible, for God's sake.

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,673
I mean, when it comes down to it.
I'm a pretty straight and honest geezer.

53
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,156
Where'd you get them?

54
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,392
I nicked them. They were in the kitchens.
They must've belonged to Headbanger Harris.

55
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,313
- Why didn't you tell the Captain, this?
- What, and get someone into trouble?

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,119
Oh no? Eight weeks painting the smegging ship?

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,431
- I'm sorry.
- Get the spacesuits.

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,515
(RIMMER'S VOICE) I don't want you to panic, Arnold.
I want you stay absolutely calm.

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm coming out in a moment, and I want you to
keep your cool. Are you ready? Here I come.

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,873
There. That wasn't too bad, was it?
Look, we found a stasis leak on Floor 16.

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,846
I'm dead, now. And you're not, but if I
save you, you won't die, so I won't die.

62
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,275
And you won't be dead
either. And neither will I!

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,911
- Good book?
- Yeah, it's all right.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,709
- I didn't think you read.
- I don't much, but this is good.

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,996
- What is it?
- It's your diary.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,479
What?!

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,076
I didn't know you sent secret
love letters to Carol McCauley?

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,073
Lister, that is my private, personal, private diary,

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,754
full of personal, private, personal things.

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,956
It's gone public.

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,160
- I don't believe it! You've been reading it out to the Cat?
- Only the best bits!

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,996
"Carol McCauley, your eyes are like
two limpid pools of loveliness."

73
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,198
- Shut up.
- "Your hair is like a golden waterfall."

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,672
- Shut up.
- "Plus those short skirts you wear make me really horny."

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,400
Lister, I order you to shut your face.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,314
- It's no big deal, yknow? You can read my diary.
- Who'd want to read your diary?

77
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,313
It's full of puerile nonsense
about Kristine Kochanski.

78
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,437
Ah, so you've read my diary?

79
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,913
Yes, but at least I have the common
decency to do it sneakily behind your back.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,799
Right, that is definitely the decent thing to do.

81
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,353
I'm doing it for a reason, anyway.
Look what I found in Kochanski's quarters this morning.

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,909
- So?
- Well, look at it!

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,162
It's a wedding photograph.

84
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,517
Yeah, and who's the incredibly
gorgeous hunky beefcake she's married?

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,399
It's you! But you didn't marry Kochanski!

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,429
Exactly! So, how is this possible,
unless somehow we go back in time?

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,640
- What's this got to do with my diary?
- It's this bit about the mushrooms, isn't it?

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,396
You see, when you saw your head coming through the table.
I don't think it was an hallucination.

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,110
I think you were seeing you now, arriving back in the past.

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,910
There's a wise old Cat saying,
which I think applies in this situation.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,356
It goes: 
"What are you talking about, dog-breath?"

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,831
Listen to what it said. It says: "The head came through the table

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,110
"and said, 'I'm from the future. I've come to save
your life. We found a stasis leak on Floor 16.""

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,273
- I don't think it was an hallucination.
- What's a stasis leak?

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,478
All right, dudes.
What's going down in groove town, then?

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,870
Alright, Hol.
Listen, what's a stasis leak?

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,951
Ooh, well, very, very basically,

98
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,714
putting it simply as I can for your average layman to comprehend,

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,509
A stasis leak is a leak, right? In stasis.

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,989
Hence the name a "stasis leak".

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,435
- You don't know, do you, Hol?
- No, I don't.

102
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,869
Well, I suggest we go down to Floor 16 and see what's there.

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,511
How come he never, ever knows anything.
He's supposed to have an IQ of 6,000?

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,471
6,000's not that much. It's only the
same IQ as 12,000 car park attendants.

105
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,597
But you don't know anything.

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,197
Listen, I happen to be one of the sleekest, most sophisticated
computers ever devised by man.

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,875
- I'm the nearest thing you can get to infullible.
- Infallible.

108
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,553
Exactly.

109
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,711
(LISTER) Floor 16.
(RIMMER) This is going to take ages.

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,360
Welcome to Xpress Lifts' descent to Floor 16.

111
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,434
we'll be going down 2,567 floors,

112
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,869
and, for a small extra charge, you can enjoy
the in-lift movie, Gone with the Wind.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,034
If you look to your right and to your left,
you will notice there are no exits.

114
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,115
In the highly unlikely event of the lift having
to make a crash landing, death is certain.

115
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,874
Under your seat, you will find a cassette

116
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,395
for recording your last will and testament,

117
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,111
and from above your head a bag will drop
containing sedatives and cyanide capsules.

118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,510
I hate this stuff, it really freaks me out.

119
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,639
To take the cyanide capsule,
simply break open, like so,

120
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,075
and place under the tongue.

121
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,199
(THUD)

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,389
Thank you for travelling Xpress Lifts.

123
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,040
We apologise for the delay.

124
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,475
You should apologise for the chicken!

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,518
First meal I ever had where the
container tasted better than the food!

126
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,832
(HUMMING)

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,318
This must be a stasis leak.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,750
OK. Here we go.

129
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,790
It's safe. Come through.

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,871
What IS it?

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,396
It's a rent in the space-time continuum.

132
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,758
- What IS it?
- The stasis room freezes time, Y'know makes time stand still.

133
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,755
so whenever you have a leak, it must preserve
whatever it's leaked into, and it's leaked into this room.

134
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,754
- What IS it?
- It's singularity. A point in the universe

135
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,878
where the normal laws of space and time don't apply.

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,999
- What IS it?
- It's a hole into the past.

137
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,038
Oh, a magic door! Well, why didn't you say?

138
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,638
It's March 2nd. That's what... three weeks
before the crew got wiped out?

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,598
(ALL) Hi.

140
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,109
Do you mind? This is the annual general
meeting of the Agoraphobic Society!

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,112
I wonder, can we bring anybody back?

142
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,671
Not unless we want them turned into powder.

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,752
- Who were you thinking of bringing back?
- Me.

144
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,990
Let's do it!

145
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,313
What's the point in going,
if you can't bring anybody back?

146
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,583
You've seen the
photograph. I marry her.

147
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:24,590
But, what's the point? In three
weeks, she'll be radioactive dust.

148
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,392
- You might as well marry a box of Daz.
- I'm gonna stay with her.

149
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,509
You're gonna stay with her? For the sake of
three weeks together, you're going to give up your life?

150
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,195
- Yeah.
- I don't believe it.

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,794
- Mr Selfish or what?
- Eh?

152
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,238
What about me? I've given you
the best years of my death!

153
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,837
Is that it, then? Three years.
"Thanks a lot, pal. I'm off!"

154
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,709
No sort of regrets? Not so much
as a lump in your throat?

155
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,317
No, you're thinking of Kochanski. The only lump 
you've got is down the front of your trousers.

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,391
I'm going for it, Rimmer.

157
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,790
If there's one thing I've learned. It's
that you don't get many shots at happiness

158
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:06,156
so when you do, go for them all.

159
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,154
I'm sharing a bunk with a character
out of a Barbara Cartland novel.

160
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,076
- What would you do in my place?
- I don't know, I... Do what you like.

161
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,756
- Where are you coming from, Rimmer? You don't even like me.
- Don't I?

162
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,656
- No
- Fine.

163
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,790
You don't though, do you?
You don't even like me.

164
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:23,275
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yeah

165
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,671
I will tell you something that
will probably stun you rigid...

166
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,878
- What?
- You're right. I don't like you.

167
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,830
I don't like what you stand for,
but for some weird reason...

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,596
I don't know. What is the point?
Everything always goes wrong for me.

169
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,676
I'm probably the only person in the world to 
buy a Topic bar without a single hazelnut in it.

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,991
It happens, you know, Rimmer.
You meet people, then you move on.

171
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,789
When I was ten, I had a mate called Duncan.

172
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,269
My best mate, you know? Taught me everything,

173
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,036
He's the one who showed me how to put mirrors
on me toecaps so I could look up girls' skirts.

174
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,714
In the end, his dad had to move to Spain because of a job...

175
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
...a bank job he pulled in Purley.
Never saw him again.

176
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,634
I think of him, though.
Every time I look at me shoes.

177
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,030
Don't try and explain it, Lister.

178
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,873
I don't know why I'm even surprised.

179
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,713
Everyone always leaves me in the end.

180
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,030
Girls, parents...

181
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,112
I had a pet lemming once.

182
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,636
I loved that little lemming.

183
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,556
I built him a little wall,
so he could hurl himself off it.

184
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,836
He didn't want for anything.

185
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,869
I'll never forget one Christmas, I put my finger
in his cage to give him some mince pie.

186
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,319
He bit me! He sunk his teeth right
into my fingers and wouldn't let go.

187
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,190
In the end, I had to smash his
brains out against my bedroom wall.

188
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,079
That little lemming broke my heart.

189
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,233
The little git completely ruined
my helicopter wallpaper.

190
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,351
You know, maybe there is a way
to bring people back from the past.

191
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,354
- Oh, how?
- Well, there's a spare stasis booth isn't there?

192
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,355
We could bring one person back if you could 
persuade them to go into suspended animation.

193
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,558
- They'd survive the accident.
- Yeah.

194
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,712
Then when we got back to now, we could bring them out, and bingo!

195
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,316
Brilliant! I could save my own life and I wouldn't be dead.

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,917
- Just think. I could bring her back...
- I could bring me back.

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,154
There'd be two mes. A dead me and a living me.
One for the week and one for Sunday best.

198
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,989
Hey! There's only room for one, and that's Krissie!

199
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,878
Rimmsie!

200
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,913
Aow! Don't look, baby. It'll drive you crazy!

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,311
What do you think? You said look inconspicuous.

202
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,636
- Put this on.
- What?!

203
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,765
- You'll stand out a mile like that.
- I wouldn't use this to buff my shoes.

204
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,189
Look, you can't walk around a mining ship
looking like a finalist from Come Jiving.

205
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,274
- But everyone will think I'm just an ordinary person!
- That's the point.

206
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,318
They won't look at me and say, "Who's that guy? He's gorgeous!"

207
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,074
- Put it on.
- Oh...

208
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,870
Well, maybe if I widen the lapels a bit, put in 
some vents and some sequins and shoulder pads...

209
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,157
- Will you put it on?
- Where's Alphabet-Head?

210
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,119
Rimmer? He sneaked off last night.

211
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,195
He's already back in the past,
trying to save his own worthless hide.

212
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,271
You reading me, Hol?

213
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,752
- Ugh, I can see right down your gob.
- Good, let's go.

214
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,231
I don't like being a watch, dangling about all sideways and upside down.

215
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,439
And give me fair warning before
you put your hand in your pocket?

216
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,990
Gave me such a fright last time, that huge liquorice allsort covered in fluff.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,756
- Oh, cheers, Hol!
- Here we go again.

218
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,831
Put that on!

219
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,397
(BOTH SINGING MERRILY)

220
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,270
Shh! Look, here it is, man. Just stick with me, OK? OK?

221
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,673
Oh. Erm... Did you order a kiss-o-gram? Sorry!

222
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,189
Excuse me, did you see a short human
with little pigtails come through here?

223
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,510
(LISTER) Yo, Cat!

224
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,431
Don't worry. It's personality that counts.

225
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,274
Felicitations, beautiful ladies.

226
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,876
Back from planet leave? Let me take those heavy cases.

227
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,919
My name is Olaf Petersen. I am very good in bed.

228
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,360
It's always an honour to carry the personal
the luggages of such beautiful ladies.

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,353
- Petersen!
- Oh, hi.

230
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,832
Petersen! How are you, mate?
I don't believe it! It's you!

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,595
I've missed you, y'know?
Give us a kiss, you smelly ol' smegger.

232
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,030
Blah! He's just a friend!

233
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,596
- I don't believe it!
- He hasn't seen me since breakfast!

234
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,638
- I'll come and see you later!
- Sure.

235
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,953
- No, I promise I'll come to your room and see ya!
- Lister, you'll die for this.

236
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,197
That was Petersen, an old mate of mine.
We were like that. I never thought.

237
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,875
I mean, just think, I'm gonna be able
to see everybody again.

238
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,989
Oi! Give us a break, Dave,
it's like a tropical rainforest.

239
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,879
- Sorry, Hol.
- Wow!

240
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,271
I've never been this close to women before!

241
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,451
It makes me wanna do something,
but I don't know what it is,

242
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:16,197
but whatever it is. I want
to do a lot of it! Yeeah...

243
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,056
(LISTER) I wonder what Rimmer's doing...
(PAST LISTER) ...ripped up and ate his wife's photograph.

244
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,696
(RIMMER) I didn't know it was his wife.
I thought it was a publicity shot from Planet Of The Apes.

245
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,239
- (LISTER) Two teas.
- Excuse me.

246
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,153
(LISTER) Listen, man, I'm sorry about those mushrooms, y'know?

247
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,516
I mean, I didn't know. I'm not totally reckless and irresponsible, for God's sake.

248
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,673
- Why didn't you tell the Captain, this?
- What, and get someone into trouble?

249
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,479
Oh no? Eight weeks painting the smegging ship?

250
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,791
- I'm sorry.
- Get the spacesuits..

251
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,875
(RIMMER'S VOICE) I don't want you to panic, Arnold.
I want you stay absolutely calm.

252
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,318
I'm coming out in a moment, and I want you to
keep your cool. Are you ready? Here I come.

253
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,552
Look, we found a stasis leak on Floor 16.

254
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,153
I'm dead now, and you're not, but If I save you, you won't die, so I won't die.

255
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:14,239
And you won't be dead
either. And neither will I!

256
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,319
- I may as well tell you right away, I know what you are.
- You do?

257
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,438
- You're a mushroom, aren't you?
- I'm a what?

258
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,469
- An hallucination. Go away.
- No, look. I'm you from the future.

259
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,860
I've come to warn you.
In three million years, you'll be dead.

260
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,031
Will I really?!

261
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,129
Yes, unless you do
something about it now.

262
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:38,149
What do you suggest?
Give up white bread. More roughage?

263
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,437
Look, you're not listening!
You've got to go into stasis.

264
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,036
- Go away!
- I'll be back soon.

265
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,875
Stay calm. It's gone now.

266
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,753
Rimmer.

267
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,594
Now you've turned into a chicken!

268
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,675
Listen, I just want to apologise.
We both got a little carried away.

269
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,311
- I've been under a lot of pressure.
- Go away.

270
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,156
Obviously, I shouldn't have given you PD.
I just got a little riled.

271
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,392
Did you indeed? How sad for you, Captain Paxo.

272
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,032
What? Oh, oh, this.
No, I... This is for the party tonight.

273
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,111
Half man, half chicken...

274
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,636
You don't scare me. Cause I know what you are.

275
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,358
(CLUCKS)

276
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,431
OWRGHHH!

277
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,833
Now kindly cluck off before I extract your giblets

278
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,153
and shove a large seasoned onion
between the lips you never kiss with.

279
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,918
Forget everything I just said!
You have got eight months PD!

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,198
Well, we have a bit of a problem here, don't we?
Because I don't take orders from poultry.

281
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,194
No, Rimmer, make that eight years!

282
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,477
Fine. I'll make a note of it shall I?

283
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,590
Eight...years... There we go.

284
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,269
- Hi, is Kristine in?
- No, she's still on planet leave.

285
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,749
Oh, smeg. Did she stay where she was staying?

286
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,674
- She said something about the Ganymede Holiday Inn?
- Cheers.

287
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,996
(LISTER) ..A-N-S-K-I. Kochanski. Look... the sun is shining!

288
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,034
(SUITCASE) Excuse me. No no, down here.

289
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,637
Have you seen a man who's lost his luggage? Er, about 5'10", mousey hair?

290
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,276
- No, I haven't.

291
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,471
Oh no, I bet they've sent him to
the wrong bloody airport again.

292
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,996
Oh sorry- Arghh! Dog!

293
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,913
And he's trying to strangle that woman!

294
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,155
Don't worry, madam.
His strangling days are over!

295
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,235
Cat, We got it. 008. This way!
Why are you attacking people's clothing for?

296
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,632
Aow! Yeah!

297
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,350
She's already married.

298
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,031
What about the photograph?

299
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,197
I'm not the groom. He's the groom!

300
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,114
(CAT) Hey! She's not as stupid as we thought!

301
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,112
Why do women always leave me
for total smegheads?

302
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,274
Why do they dump me for men
who wear turtleneck sweaters and smoke a pipe?

303
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,431
I mean, natural yoghurt eaters.

304
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,357
Reliable, sensible, dependable,
and lots of other words that end in "ible."

305
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,592
I bet he's obsessed with house prices

306
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,709
and spends half his life in antique fairs
looking for bargains and drinking wine.

307
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,589
It's never beer, is it? It's always wine.

308
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,914
"What do you want on your cornflakes, darling?"
"Oh, I'll have some wine, please!"

309
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,798
Smeg!

310
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,550
You can tell all that just from a photograph?

311
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,599
(HOLLY) Oi, not your pockets.

312
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,709
Dear oh dear... It's horrible down there.
There's a big hole. It's an unbelievable view.

313
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,475
Reminds me of that film,
Attack Of The Killer Gooseberries.

314
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,518
Come on, Hol. I'm broken up, man.

315
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,833
I was in love once... a Sinclair ZX-81,

316
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,878
People said, "No Holly, she's not for you."

317
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,636
"She's cheap, she's stupid and she wouldn't load".
Well, not for me, anyway.

318
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,441
What are you trying to say, Hol?

319
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:34,477
What I'm saying Dave, is that it's
better to have loved and to have lost

320
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,598
than to listen to an album by Olivia Newton-John.

321
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,547
Why's that?

322
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,196
Anything's better than listening
to an album by Olivia Newton-John

323
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,472
- Oh, hi. It's you.
- Hi.

324
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,837
- Come in.
- No no, we were just passing.

325
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,878
- Come in.
- No, it's OK.

326
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,237
Cat! Come on, we've got to go!

327
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,118
(CAT) Aow!

328
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,756
- I just got married.
- Oh, great.

329
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,755
- He's in the shower. I think you'll really like him.
- Oh, I bet.

330
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,834
- Do you want a screwdriver?
- I'd rather have a hammer.

331
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,511
How you doin', kid?

332
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,594
What is this? An meeting of the Ugly Convention?

333
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,957
- Where did you come from?
- The bathroom.

334
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,557
- Well, you don't look very pleased to see me.
- Well, quite frankly, I'm not.

335
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,109
I thought I was getting married.

336
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,840
- (KOCHANSKI) And you did.
- No. HE did.

337
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,029
- But he's you.
- No. I'm me!

338
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,197
- Well, who's he then?
- He's him.

339
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,559
If he's you and you're him
and you're him and he's him... am I still me?

340
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,758
Who's eatin' this chicken?

341
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,834
- What the hell is going on?
- Look, look, look. Listen...

342
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,515
In five years time, you find another way
to come back in time.

343
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,831
- So, it does work out?
- Eventually.

344
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,434
How about a frenchie from me future bride?

345
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,638
No way. On your space-bike.

346
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,357
So, listen... What do I do now?

347
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,550
- Go back to where you came from and wait for five years.
- Have I always been such a smeghead or did I change?

348
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,874
- You've always been like that. Out!
- So, listen man. You've lived my life for the last five years.

349
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,396
So what's the single most important piece
of advice that you can give me?

350
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,835
Erm... Oh, yeah.

351
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,471
Three years from now, you'll go through a
cosmic storm you'll enter a parallel universe.

352
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,918
You'll materialise on an exact replica
of Earth in the year 1989.

353
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,074
You'll want to go to the theatre. Whatever you do.
Don't go and see Run For Your Wife.

354
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,436
(LAUGHS)

355
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,796
- Smeghead.
- And you.

356
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,950
We've pumped your stomach,
we've changed your blood. Get some rest.

357
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,475
So, they won't come back again?

358
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,076
Just stay calm, keep cool and get some sleep.

359
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,712
There he is. Sleeping like a baby. I'm gonna
get better, and then I'm going to kill him.

360
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,269
If you need anything, call Holly.

361
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,155
(RIMMER'S VOICE) I don't want you to panic, Arnold.

362
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,790
but I've had a jolly big think,
and I think I know how to explain this to you.

363
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,358
(RIMMER) Hi.

364
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,913
- Hi. I'm staying calm this time.
- Good.

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,038
Yo, Rimmer, there you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.

366
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,317
- Not now, Lister.
- TWO Listers!

367
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,313
And a strange man with large teeth!

368
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,847
Hey, I'm a cat.

369
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,237
Of course you're a cat! Come
in! Sit down, there's plenty of room.

370
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,113
- Yo!
- Three Listers! Splendid!

371
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,792
Perhaps Lister here would like to go over the fridge and
open a bottle of wine for Lister and Lister?

372
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,633
Rimmer here doesn't drink, because he's dead,

373
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,189
but I wouldn't mind a glass.

374
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,673
I don't want anyone to get into a flap, here. But I'm the Rimmer
from the double-double future.

375
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm the Rimmer who's with the Lister
who married Kochanski.

376
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,856
Now, from this point on, things get a little bit confusing...

377
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,111
(ALL CHATTER)

378
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,754
Please, before anyone says anything else,
I'd just like to make a little speech.

379
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,513
(SCREAMS) Go away!

380
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,958
# It's cold outside

381
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,838
# There's no kind of atmosphere

382
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,276
# I'm all alone, more or less

383
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,478
# Let me fly far away from here

384
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,313
# Fun, fun, fun

385
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,916
# In the sun, sun, sun

386
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,356
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

387
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,717
# Drinking fresh mango juice

388
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,077
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

389
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,834
# Fun, fun, fun

390
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,595
# In the sun, sun, sun

391
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,354
# Fun, fun, fun

392
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,513
# In the sun, sun, sun #
