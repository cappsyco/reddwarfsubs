it in the shape of an envelope, I suppose?

got to eat it before the bread dissolves.

like this, Lister.

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,912

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,514
The chilli sauce, all wrong.

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,755
But put them together
and somehow it works. It becomes right.

83
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,231
- Why? Why is that?
- I suppose it's because you are a total smeghead.

But I'm not. I'm a nice guy. I'm a goodie.

85
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,789
No, Rimmer, see the trouble is you've never got time for people.
You're too busy trying to be successful.

- I want to tell you.

- Listen. Listen, Rimmer. if you tell me, right?

You'll wake up in the morning and you'll have
your hangover, and you'll feel like death,

in the mirror and you'll remember and go..."Arghh!"

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,078
See? It's not worth it. I don't want to know.
Believe me. You. Don't. Want. To tell me.

99

- Once.
- Smeg!

So? I mean, you haven't met the right girl yet.

110
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,991
No, I haven't, Lister! I haven't met
the right girl, and some just might say -

111
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,278
given the fact that the human race
no longer exists,

112
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,149
coupled with the fact that I have passed on -

113
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,598
some just might say that I'm
leaving it a little bit on the late side.

114
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,878
Well, you made a decision, didn't you? I mean,
you chose your career over your personal life.

00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,471
- They broke MY leg.
- Right.

163
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,757
- And then they did a jigsaw.
- Right.

164
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,120
Well, that's cleared that up, then.

165
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,875
Look, you're not thinking alien.
That's what aliens are - alien.

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,160
They do alien things. Things that are... alien.
Maybe this is the way they communicate.

167
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,231
By breaking legs?!

168
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,598
- And doing jigsaws?
- Why should they 'speak' the way we do?

169
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,036
- They're aliens.
- OK, Professor, what does it mean?

170
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,238
Maybe... Maybe... OK.

171
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,157
Breaking your leg hurts like hell, OK? "Hell."

172
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,358
They do it below the knee. "Low."

173
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,875
"Hell-low." Get it?

174
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,557
They do it twice. Twice. Two.

175
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,157
"Hell-Low-Two."
And jigsaw must mean you. "Hello to you."

176
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,159
I wouldn't like to be around when one
of these suckers is making a speech!

177
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,880
Hang on. The black box. Holly, the black box
will have recorded everything, won't it?

178
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,078
Yeah. Hang on. I'll fish it out.

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,440
It's gone! It's been half-inched.
Wait a minute. Let me think about this.

180
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,036
It gives off a signal. We can trace it.

181
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,833
(CRUNCH)

182
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,799
(LISTER) It's the gearbox, man. I'm telling you.

183
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,270
- Nothing yet.
- This is impossible. It could be anywhere.

184
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,352
It's like trying to find a fart in a jacuzzi.

185
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,280
Look! Down there on that moon.

186
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,474
(LISTER) Are you getting a picture now?

187
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,236
Yeah, but the quality's terrible.
It's like watching Spanish television.

188
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,200
(LISTER) Oh, my God!
(CAT) What the hell is that? Holy...

189
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,271
(LISTER) Smegorama!

190
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,070
Er, Holly, start the engines. Warm her up.
Keep her ticking over, yeah? Er, what is it?

191
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,073
(LISTER) A footprint the size of a surfboard.

192
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,151
(CAT) I don't believe the size of these feet!

193
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,279
Can you imagine the problems this guy
must have trying to get fashionable shoes?

194
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,274
(LISTER) I wonder if it's true what they
say about the size of your feet,

195
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,354
I mean, if it is, then this guy should probably go
to a fancy dress party as a petrol pump.

196
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,431
I think you should come back.

197
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,512
(LISTER) There's more of them, they lead round this corner.

198
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,816
So a surfboard foot-sized monster
came aboard, did a jigsaw,

199
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,269
drained our memories and broke a couple of legs. So what?
Forgive and forget, that's what I say.

200
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,954
(LISTER) This I don't believe!

201
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,190
It's a gravestone.

202
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,319
"To the memory of the memory of Lise Yates."

203
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,597
- Who's Lise Yates?
- You're not going to believe this,

204
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,194
but I used to go out with
a girl called Lise Yates.

205
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,877
It's only shallow.
The black box is buried in the grave.

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,513
(BLEEPS)

207
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,914
- Right, it's loaded.
- (AS BOGART) Well, play it, Sam.

208
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,991
Nice-looking bloke.

209
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,110
I don't know if anyone will ever find this,

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,274
but if they do and it's you, Dave,
or you, Arnold, don't ever play it.

211
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,795
Some things are best left buried.

212
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,032
- Why have you frozen him, Hol
- You heard what he said

213
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,990
- Knows what he's talking about, that dude.
- Come on, Holly. From Saturday night.

214
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,869
(RIMMER) Do you know how many
times in my entire life I've made love?

215
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,032
Yes, we all remember this bit.
Spin on, spin on, spin on!

216
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,472
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)

217
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,671
That many?!

218
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,679
(LISTER) Another bit of sky. A star...

219
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,558
(RIMMER WHINING)

220
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,069
This better be good. I was sleeping,
and sleeping's my third favourite thing.

221
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,276
Come and wake me up this time of night...!

222
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,232
- What is this place?
- It's the hologram simulation suite.

223
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,393
- This is the room that creates Rimmer.
- Have we come to blow this room up?

224
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,317
Look, those are his dreams and everything there.
That's what he's dreaming right at the moment.

225
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,516
# Maybe I could

226
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,273
# Really be good

227
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,558
# With someone to watch over me #

228
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,315
I'm gonna give Rimmer the
best present he will ever get.

229
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,878
- (CAT) What are you doing?
- I'm recording me memory.

230
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,190
- Your entire memory?
- Yeah. Everything.

231
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,715
Everywhere I've been, everything I've learned, my entire knowledge.

232
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,351
Right, that's it.

233
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,715
I'm gonna give Rimmer a love affair.

234
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,316
I'm gonna take eight months out of my memory, and I'm gonna paste it into his,

235
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,597
So everything that's happened to me,
he's gonna think happened to him.

236
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,231
- You're giving him one of your old girlfriends?
- I'm going to give him Lise Yates.

237
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,718
(CAT PURRS)

238
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,834
(LAUGHS)

239
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,274
God, I love you Dave. I love you so much.

240
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,476
(LISTER) And I love you, Lise.

241
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,551
A few minor adjustments.

242
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,275
- God, I love you Rimmer, I love you so much.
- (LISTER) And I love you, Lise.

243
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,351
Change the voice.

244
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,710
God, I love you Rimmer, I love you so much.

245
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,189
(RIMMER) And I love you, Lise.

246
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,989
- And that's it.
- And when he wakes up, he'll think all this happened to him?

247
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,196
Yeah, the whole eight months.

248
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,669
Man, that's a fine present.

249
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,472
He was probably only expecting a tie.

250
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,672
(ROCK AND ROLL)

251
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,351
You're in a good mood.

252
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,838
Why not, Listie, when life's so good?

253
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,957
Why is life so good?

254
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,998
You wouldn't understand, Lister.
You've never been in love.

255
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,517
- I have!
- Oh, not real love, Lister. Not like I have.

256
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,471
Not fireworks in the sky, 'From Here To Eternity'
rolling naked on the beach kind of love.

257
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,712
- Not like me and Lise.
- So, who's Lise?

258
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,239
Never you mind, Lister. Someone who was absolutely nuts about me,
that's all you need to know.

259
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,312
Fine. If you want to... keep it to yourself.

260
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,520
All I'm saying is, from now on call me Tiger. Grrr!

261
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,318
An old girlfriend, was she... Tiger?

262
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,950
Ah! What a crazy, crazy, year that was.

263
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,274
The first three months, I was at Saturn Tech
doing a maintenance course.

264
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,274
Then, for absolutely no reason,
I suddenly moved to Liverpool.

265
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,198
I drank too much. I smoked too much.
I became a total slob.

266
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,274
I met Lise, of course. I even started to eat my own toenail clippings.

267
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,869
My tastes in music radically changed.

268
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,590
I stopped adoring Mantovani
and got into Rastabilly Skank.

269
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,560
- Crazy.
- Well, you know? You were in love. You go a bit crazy.

270
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,792
It was weird. I was absolutely nuts about her,

271
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,589
- but yet started treating her really badly.
- No, you didn't!

272
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,197
I did! I started to give her some wishy-washy twaddle
about not wanting to get tied down.

273
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,319
But you were young, you didn't want to settle
down. You wanted to bum around and have a laugh.

274
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,633
- I hate bumming around and having a laugh.
- But that's what you're like when you were young.

275
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,076
I wasn't like that when I was young,
so why did I say those things?

276
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,596
I mean, she wanted you to have a career.

277
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,719
That's what I'd always dreamt of,
so why did I finish it with her?

278
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,360
Because... you wanted to play the field.

279
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,751
That's right. I told her I wanted to play the field.

280
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,755
I told her that? I must have been mad.
She was great, and she thought I was great.

281
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,549
Yeah, man, you're right. You were mad.

282
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,270
- She was a lover and a friend.
- And beautiful.

283
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,351
- Gorgeous.
- Great sense of humour.

284
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,717
- Terrific.
- The sex was fantastic.

285
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,394
- Amazing sex.
- Brilliant sex.

286
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,951
- Oh, primo, dynamite sex!
- Fantastic sex! Stupendous sex!

287
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,351
- Lister...
- The way she used to. Oh, the sex, brilliant sex!

288
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,195
- Er, Lister. Lister. How do you know?
- I'm just having a guess!

289
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,030
Kindly dont! No one will ever know

290
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,034
how beautiful the relationship
between me and Lise Yates was.

291
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,639
How could you do this, to me? It's the most heartbreakingly
tragic thing it's ever been my misfortune to witness.

292
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,238
Popcorn?

293
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,719
I'm sorry, man. I mean, obviously 
I thought I was doing you a favour.

294
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,079
What's this got to do with jigsaws, broken
legs and Godzilla-size footprints, eh?

295
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,336
- Right, smegbrain, prepare to die!
- Eh?

296
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,685
- I found the letters.
- What letters?

297
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,132
- Don't give me "what letters?"... THE letters.
- What letters?!

298
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,655
You went out with Lise Yates too.
I found the letters she sent you.

299
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,837
Oh, smeg!

300
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,835
All the time she was going out with me, she
must've been seeing you as well, behind my back.

301
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,976
And what is more, to pour salt into the wound, you used
to take her to the exact same places I used to take her.

302
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,444
- And do the exact same things.
- Rimmer, it's not what it looks like.

303
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,591
That woman is unbelievable.

304
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,430
We stayed a night in a hotel in Southport and made love six times.

305
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,071
According to her letter, you were in the exact same hotel and you made love six times, too!

306
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,876
Listen...

307
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,616
Twelve times a night? What is
wrong with the woman, she's sex mad!

308
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,916
Listen!

309
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,159
It's a good job you were there. If i'd have been
there on my own I would have been dead within a week.

310
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,437
But it doesn't make sense. I mean, she loved me.

311
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,220
Listen, listen. She wasn't going
out with us both at the same time.

312
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,753
Come on, I've checked the dates.

313
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,390
- She wasn't going out with you at all.
- She...

314
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,040
- She didn't go out with me at all?
- No, you've never even met her.

315
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,475
Is that the best you can do, Lister.
That's below feeble!

316
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,872
I went down to the Hologram Simulation Suite and I gave you eight months of my memory.

317
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,237
- What?
- It was a present.

318
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,432
You gave me eight months
of your memory as a present?

319
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,919
Yeah.

320
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,314
That's why I was an orphan,
even though my parents were alive.

321
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,876
That's why I had my appendix out twice.

322
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,076
I thought it was what you needed.

323
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,870
You've destroyed me, Lister.

324
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,912
The woman I loved most in the whole
world didn't love me, she loved you.

325
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,831
Rimmer, listen...

326
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,036
Rimmer, listen... Rimmer!

327
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,918
Oh, smeg!!

328
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,152
You should have bought him a tie.

329
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,909
Come on, Rimmer. You've experienced love.

330
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
It made you more confident, more secure.

331
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,280
- It didn't happen. I never even met her.
- It did happen.

332
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,276
I mean, you fell in love with her in a way I never did.
She's yours, now. Nothing can take that away from you.

333
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,912
That time she stuck her tongue down my ear.
It wasn't my ear at all. It was your ear.

334
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,473
The woman I loved most in the whole world
had her tongue down your ear.

335
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,794
The most romantic thing I've ever had
down my ear is a Johnson's Baby Bud.

336
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,792
Come on, as far as you're concerned you had a
love affair, right? Which was wonderful, yeah?

337
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,555
And for some reason that you can't understand, it all went hideously wrong.

338
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,840
Well, so what? Join the club, bucko. It's just you, me
and everyone else in the world.

339
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,959
- I don't want to feel like this anymore.
- So, you're in pain, yeah?

340
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,556
No, but Rimmer, if you go
through life without feeling,

341
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,473
You go through life never experiencing,
you're no better than a jellyfish,

342
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,870
no better than a bank manager.

343
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,033
I don't want this feeling anymore.
I want my own memory back.

344
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,355
OK. OK. OK. I'll erase the last four days.
Lise Yates will never have happened.

345
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,513
- But you'll know about it.
- Well, I'll erase my memory from Sunday, too.

346
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,911
- And the Cat's and Holly's.
- Fine, if they agree.

347
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,753
- What about the black box?
- I'll destroy it.

348
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,434
- It's indestructible.
- OK. I'll shoot it off into space.

349
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,356
- Someone might find it.
- OK. OK. We'll bury it! We'll bury it on some planet, yeah?

350
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,910
(LISTER) I'm going to drop it, I'm going to drop it. Put it down, man. Put it down!

351
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,798
(THUD)

352
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,598
(CAT) Why does he want a gravestone?
(LISTER) He said he wanted something somewhere, y'know?

353
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,671
so it didn't, like, disappear.

354
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,193
(GRUNTING)

355
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,199
(LISTER AND CAT SCREAM)

356
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,592
(LISTER) Arrrgh. I've broken me foot! Ah! It's broken.
(CAT) Help me find my toes!

357
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,393
OK, that's it.

358
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,632
Let's go and erase our memories.

359
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,318
# It's cold outside

360
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,198
# There's no kind of atmosphere

361
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,636
# I'm all alone, more or less

362
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,838
# Let me fly far away from here

363
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,673
# Fun, fun, fun

364
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,276
# In the sun, sun, sun

365
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,716
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

366
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,077
# Drinking fresh mango juice

367
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,437
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

368
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,194
# Fun, fun, fun

369
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,955
# In the sun, sun, sun

370
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,714
# Fun, fun, fun

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,873
# In the sun, sun, sun #
