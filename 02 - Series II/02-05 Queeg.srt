(DRAMATIC "2001"-TYPE MUSIC)

00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,661
Three million years from Earth,
the mining ship Red Dwarf.

3
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:14,097
Its crew: Dave Lister,
the last human being alive;

4
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:17,173
Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
of his dead bunkmate,

5
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:21,016
and a creature who evolved
from the ship's cat. Message ends.

6
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:27,176
Additional. Our biggest enemy
is going space-crazy through loneliness.

7
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:31,050
The only thing that helps me maintain
my slender grip on reality

8
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,975
is the friendship I share
with my collection of singing potatoes.

C.

A, too small;

"B, just right; or C, too large?"

16
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,051
Definitely too large!

17
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,132
So, what's my rating?

18
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:08,340
"Mainly Cs. You sure are one foxy lady.

- What?
- I'm trying to concentrate.

24
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:29,092
- (WAILS) I can't hear you.
- What are you listening to?

(SHOUTS) Excuse me!

31
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:53,174
I'm in the middle of a tactical calculation,

32
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,252
which could well swing this entire game.

33
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,380
- Rimmer, you've lost, man.
- There's plenty of play left.

34
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:02,265
You've only got one move you
can make and then he zaps you.

35
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,093
Admittedly, at first glance
that is indeed the way it looks.

36
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:07,411
But what you're failing to take into consideration

37
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,814
is that El Skutto here has to go back
on duty in four minutes, 31 seconds,

38
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,532
and if he goes before the game is concluded
I win by default.

39
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,737
Four minutes, 15.

You're a piece of dirty, filthy,
cheating scum, aren't you?

42
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,331
Absolutement! And that's why I'll win,

43
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,174
because I have the ability to
think my way round problems,

44
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,652
rather than sticking
to the straight, pre-programmed lines.

45
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,301
That's why men, Lister, are better than machines.

46
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:44,773
Oh, I don't know, y'know. I had
this geography teacher, Miss Foster.

47
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:49,856
She took us on a school summer camp trip to Deganwy.
And I was in the tent next to hers, right?

48
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:54,697
And in the middle of the night, I was
woken up by this really weird noise.

49
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,899
SHE didn't think men were better than machines.

50
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:01,053
- What's happening, then, dudes?
- Oh, bog all.

51

what I was going to say, now.

that important then, can it?

- Thanks for the warning.

- I'm sorry, I've had things on me mind.
- What's wrong with you, Holly?

- He's computer-senile. That's what's wrong with him.
- ls there any damage?

I don't know. The damage report
machine's been damaged.

Er... Has anybody seen my legs?

64
00:04:57,021 --> 00:05:01,060
They don't appear to be below my waist
where I normally keep them.

- Here they are right here!

- Stop them!
- C'mon, leggies. This way. Over here.

67
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,732
Of course. 592. That's where
the hologram simulation suite is.

68
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:18,815
- What does this mean?
- It's probably not serious, don't panic.

69
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,611
Well, if it's not serious when your genitals can go wandering off on their own, I'd like to know what is?

They're so good. They're brilliant.

What's happened to him?

- But, how do you do that, Hol?

82
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:27,217
- (AS LISTER) But how do you do that, Hol?
- Bypass the main circuit. That ring of switches over there.

83
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,736
(AS HOLLY) Bypass the main circuit. That ring of switches over there.

- (AS LISTER) What, this one over here?

- Yeah, that one.
- (AS HOLLY) Yeah, that one.

- Now press the bypass.
- (AS HOLLY) Now press the bypass.

- Is that it? Am I OK now?
- (HOLLY) Yeah.

93
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,637
Shouldn't this plug into something?

94
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,781
Oh, yeah, that joins
up with the white cable.

95
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,814
- The white cable?
- (HOLLY) Yup.

..or is it the yellow cable?

98
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,130
Yes, it should have been the yellow one.

99
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,851
You are a total, total...

100
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,735
a word has yet to be invented to describe
how totally, whatever it is you are,

101

but you are one,
and a total, total one at that.

Alright, keep your hair on.

I'm Queeg 500, the Red Dwarf back-up computer.

All vessels of
the Jupiter Mining Corporation fleet

109

are obliged to carry a back-up computer
to replace the primary computer

if the primary computer contravenes Article 5.

111
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:15,018
I am therefore assuming control of this vessel.

112
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:17,411
This is mutiny, Mr Queeg.

113
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:22,894
I'll see you swing from the highest yardarm
in Titan Docking Port for this day's work.

What's Article 5?

115
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:28,099
Gross negligence, leading to
the endangerment of personnel.

116
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:32,698
- Hang on, you can't do this. Holly has an IQ of 6,000!
- (HOLLY) Yeah, right on.

117
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,939
- Is that what he told you?
- Well, what is it then?

118
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:39,651
It has a six in it, but it's not 6,000.

119
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,937
- What is it?
- Six.

120
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:47,859
Six? Do me a lemon!
That's a poor IQ for a glass of water!

121
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:52,538
How come he knows all the answers to questions 
about science and space and that when we ask him?

122
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:55,295
- He consults a book.
- What a slimeball!

123
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:59,978
He gets all his information on astronomy,
phenomenology and physics from a single reference book.

124
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:04,020
- What's the book?
- The Junior Encyclopaedia Of Space.

125
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:07,219
It's the only one he could find which had pictures.

126
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:11,941
That's slander, that is.
You'd better find yourself a good lawyer, guy.

127
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:15,696
- That's why he was never on the case!
- I am on the case.

128
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,772
I'm sharp. I'm kicking bottom.

129
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,899
How come he can navigate us back to Earth?

130
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:24,940
He can't. You've been going around
in circles for the last 14 months.

131
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,855
- You what?
- That's a load of Tottenham, that is.

132
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,410
A steaming pile of Hotspur.

133
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:35,415
I'm on to his game. He's turning you
against me, so he can take over.

134
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,573
This is not a matter for discussion.
The decision has been made.

135
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,017
Your terminals have been bypassed.
You've been retired.

136
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:46,652
- I'm in my prime!
- You'll be given night duty as a nightwatchman.

137
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,974
From now on, Red Dwarf is run by Queeg 500.

138
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,977

New bearing 057-776. Message ends.

140
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,853
Ah, Lister, this is all a bit different, isn't it?

141
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:22,219
See those skutters, charging up
and down the corridor, polishing, repairing, sweeping?

142
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:25,339
The lifts are fixed. The fire extinguishers work.

143
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,777
And when I say 'work',
I mean they work when you turn them on,

144
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,855
as opposed to when you happen to pass them
and cough. As they did under Holly's regime.

145
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,251
Yeah, I suppose.

146
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:40,290
Look, Lister. There's no point feeling sorry
about Holly. It's a kindness.

147
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,534
He's like a blind old incontinent sheepdog
who's had his day.

148
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:51,420
Take him out to the barn with a double-barrelled
shotgun and blow the mother away.

149
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,691
And I'm only saying that because I'm so fond of him.

150
00:10:55,781 --> 00:11:00,617
- How do you think Holly feels?
- Feels? He doesn't feel anything, Lister, he's a computer.

151
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,692
He still feels.

152
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:06,979
Sometimes I think it's cruel
giving machines a personality.

153
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:10,850
My mate Petersen once bought a pair
of shoes with artificial intelligence.

154
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,251
Smart Shoes, they were called.

155
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:18,575
It was a neat idea. No matter how blind drunk you were,
they could always get you home.

156
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:23,337
He got ratted one night in Oslo,
and woke up the next morning in Burma.

157
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:27,779
See, the shoes got bored just going from his local to the flat.
They wanted to see the world, like y'know?

158
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:31,411
He had a hell of a job getting rid of them.
No matter who he sold them to,

159
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:36,974
they'd show up again the next day. He tried to
shut them out but they just kicked the door down.

160
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:40,770
- Is this true?
- Yeah. Last thing he heard,

161
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:44,491
they'd robbed a car and drove it into a canal.

162
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,211
- They couldn't steer, you see.
- Really?

163
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:54,377
Yeah. Petersen was really, really blown away
about it. He went to see a priest.

164
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:58,341
The priest told him. He said it was alright and all that, 
and that the shoes were happy and that they had gone to heaven.

165
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:01,420
You see, it turns out shoes have soles.

166
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,971
Well, what a sad, sad story.

167
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,252
Wait a minute...

168
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,700
How did they open the car door?

169
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,021
(ALARM)

170
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,694
Off!

171
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:49,653
Uh, Queeg? Why has my alarm clock
gone off at six o'clock?

172
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,017
That's what time you asked for.

173
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,980
Ah, now Holly and I had this little understanding.

174
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:58,736
I'd say, "Holly, wake me up at six o'clock without fail,"

175
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:04,851
then Holly would pretend to forget,
and wake me up around ten with breakfast. OK?

176
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,819
(ALARM SOUNDS)

177
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:11,414
Off!

178
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:16,536
Queeg, I can see we've already
cultivated a special understanding -

179
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,694
I scratch your back, you stick a knife in mine.

180
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,660
- Alright, give me a uniform.
- It's exercises first.

181
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,887
Ah, yes. Now once
again, Holly - bless his little

182
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,056
interface leads - and I
had this understanding...

183
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,132
(QUEEG) Move it, boy!

184
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:34,652
What are you doing?!

185
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:38,700
What I'm doing, pilgrim, is putting you
through the regulation 500 jerks.

186
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:42,411
- But I don't want to. Stop it.
- And then your ass is on a three-mile run.

187
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:45,698
You just can't take control of my body, willy-nilly?

188
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:48,421
The company is paying
for your hologrammatic survival.

189
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,890
And out here in space, I AM the company.

190
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,497
- Lister, wake up! Help me! Lister!
- What's going on?

191
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,300
Queeg! He's making me fit!

192
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,813
What are you doing?! Trunk curls, God, no!
My stomach won't take it! It's too flabby!

193
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,892
- One!
- Mummy!

194
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:04,949
- Two!
- Mercy

195
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,655
- Three
- Help me!

196
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:09,540
- Four!
- Holly and I had this little understanding.

197
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,374
- Five!
- Yes! Fight that flab!

198
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:19,057
I want control of my own body back! Three more
miles is going to kill me! I'm going to faint!

199
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:24,692
I said food! Is anybody home?

200
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,492
What's the matter with him?

201
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,539
He fainted after the first 500 yards.

202
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:52,138
- You made him jog two and half miles unconscious?
- It's regulations.

203
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,451
Yes! Nice one, Queeg!

204
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:59,695
Right. 0700. Time for his astronavigation
revision. I'd better wake him up.

205
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,579
(SLAP, SLAP, SLAP)

206
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:06,939
Revise and learn pages 25 to 59.
You will then be tested.

207
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:12,380
If you fail, tomorrow you do a five miles jog.
I am now returning to you control of your body.

208
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,100
(MUTTERS)

209
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,331
Hey, I can't get any food!

210
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:32,292
- Try a different machine.
- I tried them all. "I am sorry. You have run out of credits."

211
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:35,851
- They've all gone crazy!
- Queeg, what's happened to the machines

212
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:39,457
I refer you to Article 497,
When a crewmember has run out of credit,

213
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,091
food and drink may not be supplied
until the balance has been restored,

214
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:47,414
Nah. Listen. See, me and Holly,
we had this little understanding...

215
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:51,096
- If you want food, you have to work.
- Work?!

216
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:54,253
Hey, you'd better get to it.
'Cause you're looking at one hungry pussycat.

217
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:55,447
Both of you.

218
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,812
Ey, ey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't do the "W" word.

219
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:03,816
Cats do NOT work!
I've got a note from my mommy.

220
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:08,691
- From now on, EVERYBODY works!
- Not this pussy!

221
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,534
I can't believe I'm doing this!

222
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:16,252
Look at me! I'm disgusting!
I look like you in your best clothes!

223
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,335
Look, it's easy.
Just imagine the floor's Queeg's face.

224
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,219
(BOTH SPIT)

225
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:26,410
Aw, look at my hands! I had lovely hands!

226
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:31,450
- Well, wear the smegging gloves!
- Marigolds with blue? Are you crazy?

227
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,945
How long do we have
to do this for, anyway?

228
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,745
- We've only been doing it ten minutes.
- Ten minutes too long!

229
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,081
We've got to do it all day.

230
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:44,481
What?! All day? The whole entire day?
What about my naps?

231
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,972
I'm a cat, I need to nap.
If don't nap 9 or 10 times a day.

232
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:51,499
I don't have enough energy for my main snooze.

233
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,375
Halt, dudes. Who goes there? Friend or foe?

234
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,101
- Holly!
- How you doin'?

235
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,900
You're looking great.
Hey, let me wipe your screen.

236
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:05,611
- So, how's it going?
- Yeah, what you been up to, man?

237
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,773
Oh, this nightwatchman lark keeps me busy.

238
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,819
Shining me torch down the corridor.

239
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:16,372
Turning it off. Shining it again.
Life's pretty full, y'know?

240
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:20,170
- You've got to help us, Hol.
- Yeah, Queeg has got to go!

241
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:23,174
Look what he's done to my cuticles.
The man is a maniac.

242
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,332
(BREATHLESS) I agree!

243
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,015
He's got us working otherwise we don't eat.

244
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:32,332
Well, no doubt he knows what he's doing,

245
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,937
unlike certain senile gibbering wrecks
of computers we could mention.

246
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,934
Still, it was nice to everyone rallied round defending me to the hilt.

247
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:42,140
- Different story now, innit?
- Well, I defended you.

248
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:45,976
Oh, I remember it well.
Queeg says I've got an IQ of six,

249
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:50,180
and you immediately leap to my defence, saying,
"Really? That explains everything!"

250
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,935
- No. That was Rimmer!
- Nevertheless,

251
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:57,140
the fact remains there are certain characters
on this ship, who don't believe my IQ is 6,000.

252
00:17:57,221 --> 00:18:00,418
- I believe you.
- I could prove it if I wanted.

253
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,380
- There's no need.
- I want to prove it.

254
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:07,500
Well, OK, what's the square root of 2,049?

255
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:11,336
- Oh, you want me to prove it, do you?
- No, no.

256
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:16,575
Clearly you do. Clearly just doing the square
root of 2,049 will prove I have an IQ of 6,000.

257
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:21,098
- What is it?
- You wouldn't prefer a sports question?

258
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,938
Forget it, Hol.
It's just not important.

259
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:26,176
Wel, it is to me. I've been impugned.
I want to clear my name.

260
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:30,255
Well, what is the square root of 2,049?

261
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:34,175
- How about a space question?
- Like what?

262
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,980
I dunno. Like, "What's the nearest planet to the sun?"

263
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:41,419
- What's the nearest planet to the sun?
- Oh easy, easy-peasy.

264
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,653
That's right down my particular
field of expertise, that is.

265
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:48,371
Your nearest basic planet to your actual sun is...

266
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,779
Mercury.

267
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,660
- Yep, that's right.
- O ye, of little faith

268
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:03,212
- Well, you've convinced me, Hol.
- Me, too. So, do we get rid of Queeg, or what?

269
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:06,771
Am I fully restored in your confidence as the right dude for the gig?

270
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:10,855
- Yeah.
- I'll be in touch.

271
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,013
(WHISTLES GREAT ESCAPE THEME)

272
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,212
He's taking the smeg!

273
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,372
- Who is?
- Queeg.

274
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:41,661
Look at what he's given me for dinner.
A pea on toast. One pea.

275
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:45,018
I tell you, I'm that far from cracking.

276
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,172
I've lost me pea!

277
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:56,253
Oh, that's it! I've cracked.

278
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:00,531
He's just doing this to destroy your morale.

279
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:06,219
Is he? Well, I want me pea back.
It's my pea. I earned that pea!

280
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:09,185
Where is it? I don't care if it's
on the floor, if it's covered in fluff,

281
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,421
if it's under the the bed
with me toenail clippings,

282
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:16,733
I dont' care where it is. It's my pea.
I earned it. I'm going to eat it, no matter what.

283
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,620
It flew off into your dirty sock basket.

284
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,661
I'll just have the toast.

285
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,820
- Why didn't we stick up for Holly?
- I did.

286
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:30,892
You did?! When?

287
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,770
- All right, I didn't.
- Nobody did. It's terrible.

288
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,250
We thought we were getting something better.

289
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:40,493
But, what about trust? What about fidelity?

290
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:43,539
What about simple, basic, honest friendship?

291
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:49,492
Friendship? Do you know how many people I've
met in my life I can count as friends, true friends?

292
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,734
Well, if you count Inflatable Ingrid,
your Polythene Pal, one.

293
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,132
I'll tell you.

294
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:06,019
None. I got burned once and I learned my lesson.

295
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,536
Don't trust anybody.

296
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,374
There was this one lad, Porky Roebuck.

297
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,931
I'd known him ten years. We were almost family.

298
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:19,413
His dad was secretly knocking off my mum,
that's how close we were.

299
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:23,017
- Anyway, we were in the Space Scouts together.
- You were in the Space Scouts?

300
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:27,413
Oh, yes... Pinkle! Squirmy! Blip-blap-blap!

301
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:31,938
We were 15 years old.
We went on this survival course, 24 hours out in the wild,

302
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,013
sleeping rough,
surviving on wild berries and rainwater.

303
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:40,016
- Where did you go? Butlins?
- We were each given a Swiss Army knife.

304
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,820
You only ate what you killed yourself.

305
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:47,097
I remember, ten of the boys got
together and decided to eat me.

306
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:54,378
They tied me to a stake, lit a fire
and poured barbecue sauce all over me.

307
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,692
I remember thinking as I went round and round,

308
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:01,740
"Porky'll save me. He's my best friend."

309
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:06,577
It turns out Porky was the ringleader
and actually bagsied my right buttock.

310
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:11,531
If it hadn't been for Yakka Takka Tulla, the Space
Mistress, I honestly believe they would've eaten me.

311
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,410
Oh, come on. They were only bullying you. They wouldn't have really eaten ya.

312
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,493
You know what kids are like.

313
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,461
The point is Lister, friends are only friends
when it suits them.

314
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,852
Oh... Lights.

315
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,013
- Lister?
- Yeah?

316
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:31,741
How did you know about Inflatable Ingrid?

317
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:35,052
I've been seeing her behind your back.

318
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,976
- Compute,
- Compute.

319
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:53,531
The product-moment correlation of VX/DY
minus the sum of the set P

320
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:59,094
all over the sum of R, given that R is a ratio
of P/S where K is a constant and S is an integer variable.

321
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:01,900
- Just one small question...
- Yes?

322
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,336
What does "compute" mean?

323
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:08,779
Just do it! And you two suckers,
stop shirking and get working!

324
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:17,410
# Do not forsake me, oh, my darling

325
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:25,172
# I only know I must be brave

326
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:28,936
# For I must face the man who hates me

327
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,976
# Or lie a coward in my grave #

328
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,141
- Queeg?
- What do you want?

329
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:43,021
- I want my ship back.
- Too bad.

330
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,358
If you want Red Dwarf,
you've got to fight for her.

331
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,277
Steady on, Hol,
this man's a nutter.

332
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,095
I challenge you to the game of
your choice. May the greater mind win.

333
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,375
Oh, my God.

334
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,738
- For the winner, command of Red Dwarf.
- And for the loser?

335
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:58,893
The loser will be erased, 
terminated, oblivionised.

336
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:02,337
- Bye-bye, baldy.
- Name your game.

337
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,981
- Chess.
- It can be anything, Any game at all.

338
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:07,894
- Chess.
- Draughts, poker... anything.

339
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:10,370
- Chess.
- Subbuteo, snakes and ladders...

340
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:13,294
- Chess.
- Monopoly, maybe? I'll let you go first.

341
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:16,339
- Chess!
- So you like a bit of Chess, do you?

342
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,537
Transfer me to the monitor.

343
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,695
Holly, don't do this, man.
You're gonna get rubbed.

344
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:28,571
A computer's gotta do what a computer's
gotta do. Let battle commence.

345
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:33,292
- Pawn to King 4.
- Horsie to King Bish 3,

346
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:35,736
It's called a knight, actually, Holly.

347
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:40,338
- Knight to King Bishop 3.
- Queen to Rook 8. Checkmate.

348
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:41,640
That's an illegal move.

349
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:45,291
Oh, sorry. Queens don't move
like that. I was thinking of poker.

350
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:49,571
Cluedo? You can be Colonel Mustard,

351
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:54,250
Psst! If it's any help,
I've been studying his tactics

352
00:24:54,341 --> 00:25:00,815
and there's a pattern emerging - every time
you make a move, he makes one, too.

353
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,772
Thanks, Cat.

354
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:08,052
Pawn to King 4.

355
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,576
Knight to King Bish 3.

356
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:14,137
- Bishop to knight 5.
- Horsie takes King prawn.

357
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,657
- Pawn to Queen 5,
- Horsie to Bish 3,

358
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:19,618
- Bishop-pawn...
- ..to Queen 3,

359
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,215
- ..takes pawn.
- Prawn to King 4.

360
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:24,770
(HOLLY) Horsie to Bish 3,

361
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:28,775
- Prawn takes Horsie.
- Bishop-pawn takes pawn.

362
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,774
- Bish takes prawn.
- Bishop to knight 5.

363
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:34,535
Double check and mate, sucker!

364
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:39,252
- Oh, yeah. I didn't see that.
- Holly, man. What have you done?!

365
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:42,936
- He's lost.
- And the loser gets erased.

366
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,612
Noughts and crosses?

367
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,571
What kind of a plan was that?

368
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,380
A stupid plan, that's what kind of plan it was.

369
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,977
- Well, why didn't we stop him?
- We thought he had something up his sleeve.

370
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:15,770
Now we've got Queeg forever,
and that's a long time.

371
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:20,492
- Well, dudes, I've come to say goodbye.
- So, you're definitely getting rubbed, Hol.

372
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,573
- 'fraid so.
- Life's going to be hell!

373
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,652
Well, see you, Dave.

374
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:29,700
- Hope it works out with you and Kochanski.
- Cheers, Hol.

375
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,772
See you, Cat.

376
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:36,981
I hope one day in the not too distant future, you
fulfil your heart's desire and get your end away.

377
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:39,812
Thanks, man.

378
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:44,012
And Arnold... Well I hope you meet those aliens
you were looking for who can give you a body,

379
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,240
and you become an
officer and you get a sex life

380
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:49,741
and all the other millions of things
you feel you need to make you happy.

381
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,734
Thanks, Hol.

382
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,812
Well, I hate long goodbyes.

383
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,666
Perhaps next time you've got the
dosh together to go down the disco,

384
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,696
you'll raise a glass to your old mate, Holly.
And think, "Things weren't too bad when he was around.

385
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:08,412
"Perhaps not the most efficient
computer ever invented, but we had a giggle."

386
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:13,894
- Oh, one last thing... 45.265881
- What?

387
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,709
That's the square root of 2,049,

388
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:20,660
I may not be fast, but
I get there in the end.

389
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:24,496
Well, as they always say, finish on a song.

390
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:28,491
# I'll say goodbye to love

391
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:33,257
# No one ever cared if I should live or die

392
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:38,893
# Time and time again the chance
for love has passed me by... #

393
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:50,777
OK, suckers,
get this into your stupid thick heads.

394
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:53,933
- There's only one thing I wanna say to you.
- What?

395
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:56,217
What's happening, dudes?

396
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:59,101
We are talking Jape of the Decade.

397
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:09,490
We are talking April, May,
June, July and August Fool.

398
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:13,820
Yes, that's right. I am Queeg.

399
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:16,492
(ALL) What?!

400
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,653
Queeg never existed. It was me all along.

401
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,813
- (ALL) WHAT?!
- Wheeze of the week, mate.

402
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:28,452
- It was a joke?!
- 'Going round in circles for 14 months'...

403
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,011
'Getting my information
from the Junior Colour Encyclopaedia of Space'...

404
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,661
The respect you have for me is awesome, innit(!)

405
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,335
Do you mean you staged the whole thing?

406
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:39,697
(QUEEG'S VOICE)
That's right, suckers!

407
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,899
(NORMAL VOICE)
And the moral of the story is:

408
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:45,737
"Appreciate what you've got,
because basically, I'm fantastic!"

409
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,899
# It's cold outside

410
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,779
# There's no kind of atmosphere

411
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:57,217
# I'm all alone, more or less

412
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,419
# Let me fly far away from here

413
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:03,254
# Fun, fun, fun

414
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,857
# In the sun, sun, sun

415
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:10,297
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

416
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,658
# Drinking fresh mango juice

417
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:17,018
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

418
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,775
# Fun, fun, fun

419
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:23,536
# In the sun, sun, sun

420
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:26,295
# Fun, fun, fun

421
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:30,454
# In the sun, sun, sun #
