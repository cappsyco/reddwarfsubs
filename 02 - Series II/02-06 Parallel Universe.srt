(POP MUSIC)

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,917
# When I saw you for the first time
# First time

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:18,460
# My knees began to quiver
# Quiver

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,011
# And I got a funny feeling
# Feeling

5
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:26,015
# In my kidneys and my liver
# Digestive system, baby

6
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,492
# My hands they started shakin'
# Shakin'

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,812
# My heart began a-thumpin'
# Boom, boom, boom!

8
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:36,132
# My breakfast left my body
# Huey, huey, huey

9
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,735
# It all really tells me something

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:41,176
# Girl, you make me tongue-tied
# Tongue-tied

11
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:42,899
# Tongue-tied

12
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,258
# Whenever you are near me
# Near me

13
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,900
# Tied tongue
# Tied tongue

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,654
# Tied tongue
# Tied tongue

15
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,971
# Whenever you're in town

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,859
# I saw you across the dance floor
# Dancing

17
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:02,775
# I thought of birds and bees
# Reproductive system, baby

18
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:05,933
# But when I tried to speak to you
# Talk, talk

19
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,651
# My tongue unravelled to my knees
# Flippety-flippety-flop

20
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:13,132
# I tried to say "I love you"
# Love you

21
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,851
# But it came out kind of wrong, girl
# Wrong, girl

22
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,932
# It sounded like, "Noo-noony-nee-noo"

23
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,252
# Tongue-tied
Na-ner-ner-ner-nee-nung, nirl

24
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,015
# Because you make me tongue-tied
# Tongue-tied

25
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,694
# Tongue-tied

26
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:30,092
# Whenever you are near me
# Near me

27
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,811
# Be-dobby-durgle, dobby-durgle
# Tongue-tied, tongue-tied

28
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,290
# Whenever you're around

29
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,860
# Oh, I'm beggin' on my knees

30
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,855
# Sweet, sweet darling, listen, please

31
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:54,333
# Understand me when I say

32
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:59,060
# Bedurble diggle doggle-
dooby-doggle-durgle-day

33
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,850
# I'm trying to say nungy-nangy
# Nangy-nongy

34
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,739
# Ningy-nongy

35
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,893
# Why can't I tell you clearly?
# Clearly

36
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,813
# Be-dobby-durgle
# Dobby--durgle

37
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,619
# Durgle-dobby
# Durgle-dobby

38
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,374
# Whenever you're around... #

39
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,501
- No, this isn't the one.
- What isn't?

40
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:23,212
I'm looking for this dream I had last month
on the dream recorder. It was sensational.

41
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:26,498
- What was it about?
- Me, three girls

42
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,141
and a family tub of banana yoghurt!

43
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:32,452
You cats have a strange attitude to women,
if you ask me.

44
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,896
Say what, goalpost-head?

45
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,461
It's all sex. There's no sense of settling down,
having a long-term relationship.

46
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,172
Hey, I want to settle down, and as soon as I find
the right small group of girls,

47
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:48,858
the seven or eight women who are right for me,
my wandering days are over, buddy.

48
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,932
You see? Totally maladjusted.

49
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,854
That's rich, y'know? I mean coming from the man whose favourite book

50
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,138
is "How To Pick Up Girls By Hypnosis".

51
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:02,091
There's nothing wrong with that, Lister.
It's a good book. Full of handy hints as well, and it works.

52
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,172
Get outta town!

53
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:09,370
That's how I met Lorraine.
By hypnotising her.

54
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,101
You hypnotised a girl into going out with you?

55
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:17,301
Yes. I gave her the old
"There's something in your eye" technique,

56
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:23,093
fixed her with the Mesmer stare...
and bingo, she agreed to come on a date.

57
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:26,060
- What was wrong with her?
- Nothing.

58
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,418
Come on. A girl agreed to go out with
you, and there was nothing wrong with her?

59
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,300
Lister, she was an extremely
attractive and bright young lady.

60
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,372
Oh, well it MUST work, then.

61
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:38,420
- Of course, she had an artificial nose.
- What?!

62
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,813
Oh, tastefully done. Quality metal, no rivets.

63
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:48,021
- Come on, what happened?
- Well, things were a bit stilted in the taxi.

64
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:51,457
All my jokes about her nose
hadn't gone down too well.

65
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:56,854
They were good gag, quality gags, like,
"Where are we going?" "Who nose?"

66
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,932
No cheap shots.

67
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:02,776
Anyway when we got to the restaurant, she must
have had an attack of nerves or something.

68
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:06,616
She said she was going to the loo and
ended up climbing out of a toilet window.

69
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:11,059
- I wonder why.
- It's not because she didn't want to see me, Lister.

70
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,213
She phoned the next day and said how much
she'd love to come on another date with me,

71
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,020
only, suddenly she had to move to Pluto.

72
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,173
You're a sad weasel of a man,
you know that, Rimmer?

73
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:23,572
No, it's just I'm ill at ease with the opposite sex.

74
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:27,734
It's because you see them as some alien species that need to be conquered with trickery.

75
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,975
They're not, they're people. You don't need your books
on hypnosis ...and what's that other one, what's the other one?

76
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,621
"1001 Fabulous Chat-up Lines."?

77
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:39,535
Lister, I do need that, it's brilliant, those chat-up lines are guaranteed.

78
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:44,252
- There's no such thing.
- All right. You be a woman, OK?

79
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:50,541
Sort of... on your own in a bar,
short leather miniskirt, peephole bra...

80
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,612
OK. Go on.

81
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:56,979
This is the most incredible chat-up line
you've ever heard in your life, Guaranteed.

82
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,575
- Go on.
- OK... in a bar on your own...

83
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:05,741
Excuse me, would you like
to join me for a cocktail?

84
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,654
- No.
- You can't say no.

85
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:12,696
- It doesn't work if you say no. You've got to say yes.
- Oh, right. OK. Go on, go on...

86
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:19,217
- So, would you like a wormdo?
- What's that, then?

87
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,815
- What's what?
- A wormdo.

88
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:27,860
- What about it?
- Is this still the opening line?

89
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,491
- Look, you're not giving me the right reply!
- What IS the right reply?!

90
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,505
I come up to you and say
"Excuse me, would you like to join me in a cocktail?"

91
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,495
You say "Yes".

92
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:39,893
I say, "Would you like a wormdo?"
You say, "What's a wormdo?" and I say...

93
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:43,292
- "Oh, it wriggles along the ground like that."
- You know it!

94
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:48,137
Rimmer. You could not pull a rotten tooth
out of a dead horse's head with that one.

95
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,259
- Eureka. I've done it.
- Done what?

96
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:53,730
The Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich.

97
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,812
Samuel Morse invented the Morse Code,

98
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,734
Plato invented the plate...

99
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,860
and now I, Holly,
have invented the Holly Hop Drive.

100
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:08,300
- Ooh, I can't wait to see it (!)
- It's monumental, this. it's epoch-making.

101
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:12,295
The Holly Hop Drive can transfer any object
instantly to any other point in space.

102
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:16,170
- What? You mean we could go back to Earth?
- In a matter of seconds.

103
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:20,812
What, you mean we can go back to
Earth, like, right now? This instant?!

104
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,780
- Right on.
- Rock and roll!

105
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,892
- What, is this it?!
- What do you think?

106
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,611
It's just a box with "Stop" and "Start" on it!

107
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,332
It's fairly straightforward.

108
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:50,337
If you want to start it, press "Start"...

109
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,891
You can work out the rest of the controls for yourself.

110
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,973
It's absolutely pathetic.

111
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,698
Right. Let's Holly Hop. Engage drive...

112
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:03,500
Drive engaged. Initiating ignition sequence...

113
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:06,892
- Ignition sequence initiated.
- Get on with it.

114
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,691
It takes time, this. One slight error
in any of my 13 billion calculations,

115
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,818
we'll all be blasted to smithereens.

116
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,576
Here we go, then. Ten... Nine... Eight...

117
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:20,301
- Six.. Five...
- You missed out the seven.

118
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:24,776
Did I? I've always had a bit
of a blind spot with sevens.

119
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,370
We're going to die.

120
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,180
No problem. I'll start lower down.

121
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,172
One... Blast off.

122
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,616
We've done it. We're home.

123
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,535
- It worked?
- We're at Earth? You must be joking!

124
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,897
Half a mo'...

125
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,096
- It's gone,
- What has?

126
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:54,890
The Earth. It's missing. It's not there.

127
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:59,381
Wait a minute.
Sorry, I was looking out the wrong window.

128
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,900
No. No, it HAS gone.
The entire solar system is missing.

129
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:09,930
- Well, what is actually out there?
- Nothing. Just space.

130
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:16,461
Holly, the thought occurs
that we haven't actually reached Earth.

131
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:21,251
The further thought occurs that we
haven't actually budged a smegging inch.

132
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,737
No, no, we have.

133
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:28,940
It's just I don't know where we are.
I've got to admit it, I've flamingoed up.

134
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:33,618
- What?
- Well, it's like a cock-up, only much, much bigger.

135
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,534
Wait, there is something there. It's another ship.

136
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,739
- Aliens!
- (LISTER) Punch it up.

137
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:43,860
- It looks like an exact copy of Red Dwarf.
- Eh? So, what's happened?

138
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,932
Well, somehow - don't ask me how -

139
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,467
We've jumped into a parallel universe.
We've entered the fifth dimension.

140
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,016
What's the fifth dimension?

141
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:55,140
Didn't they get to Number Six
with "Baby, I Want Your Love Thing"?

142
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:59,419
You've got your basic dimensions, right? -
length, breadth, depth and time.

143
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,856
The fifth dimension is co-existing realities,

144
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,411
two bodies who share the same space,
but are unaware of each other's existence.

145
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:08,573
Sounds like my parents in bed.

146
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:13,340
So, hang on, this is another Red Dwarf,
with another Rimmer and Lister on board?

147
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,157
Will they be exactly
the same as us?

148
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,416
No, there'll be differences.
It's a parallel universe, innit?

149
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:19,638
What do you mean?

150
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:23,098
Well for instance, In this universe, it
could be that Hitler won the Second World War

151
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:27,573
it could be something even more incredible,
like perhaps Ringo was a really good drummer.

152
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:31,973
Hang on, I'm linking up
with their onboard computer.

153
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,611
- Hello, I'm Hilly.
- Hello, I'm Holly.

154
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,614
- Hello, Holly.
- Hello, Hilly.

155
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:43,730
This is a turn-up, innit You'd better
boogie on over and we can sort it out.

156
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:45,812
Right on, sis.

157
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,370
- See you, Hol
- See you, Hil

158
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,532
I'm in there.

159
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:12,134
It's identical in every detail to our Red Dwarf!

160
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:16,499
Very funny smell around here
that I don't like one bit.

161
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:20,620
It smells like your moon boots, man.
I'm going to get rid of it.

162
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,492
That's mine. This is mine...

163
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:27,019
So, where's the other Rimmer and Lister?

164
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,897
So, you're not aliens.

165
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:36,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,737
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

167
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,664
You must be Lister?

168
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,530
- And you are, too.
- Hope so.

169
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,376
- You must be Rimmer. So am I.
- Splendid.

170
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,532
- Deb.
- Dave.

171
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,180
- Arnold.
- Arlene.

172
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:56,218
Indeedy!

173
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:16,340
So, you come from a universe which
is exactly the same as ours... Can I?

174
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,014
Yeah.

175
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,772
Only everything's... opposite?

176
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:27,820
I don't know if everything's opposite.
It seems like that.

177
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:31,053
So, you come from a female-orientated society?

178
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:34,372
Well, it's not exactly female-orientated
any more,

179
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,535
not since the '60s, y'know?
With the "Equal Rights For Men" marches.

180
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,817
You know, when they burned
their jockstraps and all that?

181
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,699
Stop!

182
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,819
Haven't you read "The Male Eunuch"
by Jeremy Greer?

183
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:51,134
So, your history is parallel to ours, as well?

184
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,293
So, hang on, erm, who was the first person on the moon?

185
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,338
Nellie Armstrong.

186
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,458
NELLIE Armstrong?

187
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,250
- So... who wrote Hamlet?
- Will Shakespeare.

188
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:07,699
- Ah, so he was a bloke.
- No, she was a woman. Wilma Shakespeare.

189
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,332
Yes, she wrote all the greats - "Rachel III",
"The Taming Of The Shrimp"...

190
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,981
My God, what's this?

191
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:18,338
- My Camera Monthly magazine.
- Well, it's disgusting!

192
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:22,733
It's full of semi-naked blokes
draping themselves over sports cars.

193
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:26,371
What's wrong with that? You're not one
of those boring masculinists, are you?

194
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:31,059
So, sexual attitudes are opposite, as well?

195
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,735
What's that, my little cupcake?

196
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,858
Your little what?!

197
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:41,334
It just looks ridiculous!
I mean, these models are deformed, hugely deformed.

198
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:44,539
It makes one feel quite... inadequate.

199
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:50,895
- Don't worry about that, my pretty.
- Hey! Holograms can touch each other!

200
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:55,930
Hey, hey hey hey! I hate to break up the party,
but isn't there somebody missing?

201
00:12:56,021 --> 00:13:00,538
- How do you mean?
- Well, Lister, female opposite.

202
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,898
Rimmer, female opposite. Where's mine?

203
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:07,178
Oh, right. Mooching around the cargo decks, I think.

204
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:12,939
Aow! All my life I've waited
for this moment, and now it has arrived!

205
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:19,131
Hey listen, if you hear me screaming,
do NOT, I repeat, do NOT come to the rescue!

206
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:21,212
Aaaaooooow!

207
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,293
# I'm gonna get you, little kitty... #

208
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:27,772
- I think he's in for a bit of a shock.
- Why?

209
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:30,933
- His opposite isn't female.
- What is it?

210
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:33,012
It's a dog.

211
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,540
Oh, Boy, oh, boy! Where'd they go?

212
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:41,899
I get so dang panicky when they go
off and leave me on my own like this.

213
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,052
Damn these fleas!

214
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,094
# I'm gonna get you, little kitty...

215
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,697
# I'm gonna get you, little... #

216
00:13:55,141 --> 00:14:00,614
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure he wants to eat me.

217
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:05,898
Well, trash my shorts, what a funny-looking dog!

218
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,780
I'd better make myself look big!

219
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,777
Put it there, Buddy, but it right there!

220
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:16,219
Goddamn! What kind of toothpaste
does he use? Rotting meat flavour?

221
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:19,931
Come on, now. I wanna be your buddy!

222
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:25,255
Tell you what, I'm gonna smell
your behind, then you can smell mine!

223
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:29,653
- Now, is that a deal?
- You wanna smell my WHAT?!

224
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,859
Why, sure! Don't you wanna smell me?

225
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:38,220
Man, I could smell you if you was on Mars!
When's the last time you take a bath?

226
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,895
- Oh, please, don't say that word!
- What? Bath?

227
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:46,897
You said it again! Now, listen up.
If y'all gonna say that word in front of me, please spell it.

228
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:50,815
When did you last you took a B-A-T-H?

229
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,332
What's that?

230
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:56,381
Yo, Cat... There you are.

231
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:59,419
- Come on, we're going to the disco.
- What?

232
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,778
Yeah, Holly says it's gonna take
about 17 hours to repair the Hop Drive,

233
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:08,233
- so I thought we'd go and have a few... bevvies, like?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! Come on!

234
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,374
- Yeees
- Aaoooooowww.

(DISCO MUSIC)

236
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,091
Well, they seem to be getting on, don't they?

237
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:45,173
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Oh, yes.

238
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,253
- Like a house of fire.
- You can say that again.

239
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,897
- Oh yes.
- ...Yes.

240
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:53,980
Mind you, we've got a pretty good 
conversation going on here.

241
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,972
Oh, yes, yes.

242
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,052
Absolutely.

243
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:02,374
Funny, really. I'm not normally good
at talking to the opposite sex.

244
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,852
No, I'm not. I run out of things to say.

245
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,892
Me, too.

246
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,692
So, you're a girl, then?

247
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,055
- Yes.
- That's nice.

248
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:28,419
Hang on. Haven't you got something in your eye?

249
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,812
You're trying to hypnotise me, aren't you?

250
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,633
- No, of course not.
- Well, stop staring, then.

251
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,037
- I'm not staring
- Yes, you are.

252
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,532
OK! I read it in this book.
It's great for picking up bits of totty.

253
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,459
Well, I'd hardly describe myself as "a bit of totty".

254
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:48,656
Oh, yes!

255
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,655
Totty, totty... totty.

256
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:56,655
I- I think you've had rather too much to drink.
I always get like this when I'm tanked up

257
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,971
Come on. You're interested.

258
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,691
- I assure you, I'm not.
- Why are you giving me all the signs, then?

259
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:06,217
- What signs?
- Wearing such tight trousers?

260
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:09,578
- They're not tight.
- Course the are, you're begging for it.

261
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,455
I'm not "totty" and I'm not begging for anything.

262
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:19,297
Come on, give us a snog, I promise I won't try
to take off your underpants.

263
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:23,261
Look, I'm sorry, I'm just not that kind of... boy.

264
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:28,179
Frigid!

265
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,500
You're disgusting!
You're only after me for one thing!

266
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:35,050
Why? How many have you got?

267
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,252
You're a great conversationalist, you know that?

268
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:45,653
- I am. But I ain't said nothin' yet...
- Yeah, that's what I like best.

269
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:49,291
- Yo, Listen. I'm going to the bar, do you want anything?
- Yeah, I'll have a grenade, Thank you.

270
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:52,692
- A grenade?
- Yeah. I wanna play fetch with the dog.

271
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:01,457
Listie! How are you, my
old mate. Come and join us.

272

Please, God, come and join us!

If you want to keep your beer cool,
stick it between his legs.

275
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:18,051
What was all that about?

276
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:21,771
- That's the most awful woman I've ever met.
- She's you.

277
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,852
She's absolutely repugnant.

278
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,588
She doesn't treat me like I'm
a normal human being at all.

279
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:29,539
She seems to regard me as
some sort of discardable sex object.

280
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:34,331
- She's the female equivalent of you.
- Nonsense. She's maladjusted.

281
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:39,814
Trust my luck to end up with El Weirdo,
while you trap off with the one with the juicy jugs.

282
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:44,975
See! I mean, she thinks of men the exact
same way you think of women. It's disgusting.

283
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:49,100
She accused me of wiggling my bottom
in a provocative way.

284
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:52,617
I was just walking!
Can I help it if I happen to be sexy?

285
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,134
- What's the other one like?
- Totally gross.

286
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,735
She's unbelievable. She tried to impress me

287
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:02,894
by drinking six pints of lager, then
belching the whole of "Yankee Doodle Dandy".

288
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,052
That's your party piece, isn't it?

289
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:09,259
Yeah, but when I do it, it's really stylish, man.

Get outta town!

I mean, she's a good laugh and
all that. But all she wants to do

295
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,060
is get, like completely blitzed
out of her brains and eat vindaloos.

296
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:29,021
I mean, call me crazy,
but I just don't find that attractive.

297
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,457
- How you getting on then?
- Well, put it this way,

298
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,375

under the bed tonight.

Wallop, eh?

300
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:43,854
He doesn't look too interested to me.
He looks more sort of, er... petrified.

301
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:48,936
Oh, he just doesn't want me to think
he's the ship's bike, but I'm getting the signs.

302
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:54,733
He crossed his legs and made pretty damn sure
I saw that he was wearing sock suspenders. Phwoar!

303

- Rimmer, he's not interested.
- Maybe not now, but wait till I hit him with the wormdo line.

Boy, I tell you, when I hit the dance floor,
I am one mean turkey! Do you dance?

319
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:13,339
- The lipstick mark.
- That's not a lipstick mark. That's a computer rash.

320
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,095
Holly, just get the Hop Drive
fixed and get me out of here.

321
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,412
What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?

322
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,538
A good time?!

323
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,612
Lister... (CLEARS THROAT)

324
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:27,410
I'm going to bed now, by myself, on my own, alone.

325
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:30,857
If she comes back, tell her I've
got a headache or something.

326
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,653
- Why, where's she gone?
- She's gone to get some sexy videos.

327
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:38,216
She seems to think seeing two
men together might turn me on.

328
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:42,340
- Where are you sleeping?
- I'm not telling you. It's too risky.

329
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,837
Come on, what are you,
are you a man or a munchkin?

330
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,860
# I'm off to see the wizard...
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz... #

331
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,296
Oh, are we ready, then? OK, after three... Three!

332
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,179
Ha! Beat you!

333
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,656
Oh, did I get drunk or did I get drunk?

334
00:22:16,941 --> 00:22:18,739
Oh, no.

335
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:23,820
Oh, did I get drunk or did I get drunk?

336
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,300
Hi.

337
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:28,134
- Hi.
- Listen. Did we, erm...?

338
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:30,812
I can't remember.

339
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:37,091
I can remember betting you that  I could
climb the disco wall using only me lips...

340
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:43,457
And then... Oh, God,
I juggled the goldfish, didn't I?

341
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:46,179
Blindfold.

342
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,499
And then...

343
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,651
Oh, eh. we did, didn't we?

344
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,460
You pieces of filth.

345
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,250
How could you commit an act
of carnal knowledge...?

346
00:22:58,341 --> 00:23:01,572
..on my bunk, on my sheets, using my springs?

347
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,813
How could you contemplate
making love to yourself?

348
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:08,610
Well, why break a habit of a lifetime?

349
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:13,337
Leave it out! I was gonzoed. Man, I was out of me skull.

350
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:15,537
Oh hey, what's that supposed to mean?

351
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:20,013
I wouldn't have slept with you
if I'd known what I was doing.

352
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:23,253
- Thanks a lot!
- I hope you get pregnant.

353
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:26,697
No offence, man. But you're not exactly "Mr Difficult To Pull" are you?

354
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,772
Talk about a pushover!

355
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:32,616
Oh, That's rich coming from Miss Yo-Yo Knickers.

356
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:39,012
I hope you get pregnant, you cheap little tart!

357
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,173
- You what?
- Er, him? How can he get pregnant?

358
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:45,856
Well, if they didn't use precautions,
he could be up the spout.

359
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:50,299
- But it's women who get pregnant!
- Since when?

360
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:53,612
Since always! Me mother was a woman!

361
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:56,773
Ooooh, Listie!

362
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:00,138
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

363
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:05,295
If I'm understanding correctly,
it appears that in their universe,

364
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:08,339
it's the men who give birth to the babies.

365
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:14,861
As we are in their universe, you could very
well possibly be up the duff, laddie!

366
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:20,379
- Come on, I'm not buying this. This is a wind-up!
- Don't get emotional. Not in your condition!

367
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:26,060
It's impossible! I haven't got the...
the equipment, have I?

368
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:29,736
Course you have. You're in our universe. Our physical law applies.

369
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,620
Shut up!
Holly, tell me this isn't true.

370
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:38,060
- I'm afraid it is... Mum.
- How could you do this to me?

371
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:41,975
- Do what?
- Fertilise me. Take advantage of me,

372
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:45,417
knowing I was drunk, I didn't have precautions.

373
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:50,735
Listen, I assumed you'd taken care of that side of things.
It's the man's responsibility.

374
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:56,100
It's the man who gets pregnant.
It's the man who has to suffer the agony of childbirth.

375
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,378
Agony? This gets better and better!

376
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:05,537
- Look, What do you want me to do? I'm sorry, OK?
- Sorry? That's it? Sorry?

377
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,817
Wham, bam, thank you, mister?

378
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:13,379
Well, there's no point standing around arguing about it.
If it's happened, it's happened.

379
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,499
Yeah, We'd better get back. I've fixed the Hop Drive.

380
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,131
No, we can't go now, Hol! She could be the father of my child!

381
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,976
- If we don't go back now, we won't be abel to get back at all.
- Listen...

382
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,497
Just because it's possible for you to get pregnant,

383
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,414
it doesn't mean you necessarily are.

384
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:32,492
You might get lucky.

385
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,971
But then again, you might not.

386
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,417
we'll find out when we get back, won't we, Listie?

387
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:46,572
Engaging Holly Hop...

388
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,652
Holly Hop engaged.

389
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:51,574
Four... Three... One... Blast off.

390
00:25:58,061 --> 00:26:02,453
I don't know why I'm going through with this.
It's just not possible!

391
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,420
Why is it not possible?
Male baboons have given birth.

392
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:10,257
They were doing that as far back
as the 20th century. Caesarean, naturally.

393
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,537
(MAKES SLASHING
AND THUDDING SOUNDS)

394
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:17,976
Still, Lister. You'll be in good hands. The Skutters will be able to handle a simple Caesarian.

395
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:22,259
Skutters?! I wouldn't let them
open a can of beans.

396
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,810
You're thinking too negative!

397
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:30,101
Think of all the glorious, beautiful,
wondrous things about having children!

398
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:32,821
- Like?
- Like when they grow up and leave home.

399
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:38,733
- What colour's it supposed to turn?
- Blue for not pregnant... which is the colour it's going to turn.

400
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,971
- And red for pregnant?
- Yeah.

401
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,860
Come on, you reds!

402
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,852
- What colour is it now?
- Er, it's still white.

403
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:53,619
Oi. I've just had a thought. Remember when we broke the light
barrier and saw those echoes from the future?

404
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:57,296
- Yeah.
- And we saw your future self with twin boys.

405
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:01,420
Right. And I said, "How is it possible to get two babies without a woman on board?"

406
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:05,540
And you said, "I don't know, but it's going to be a lot of fun finding out."

407
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:09,615
- How right you were, Listie!
- Twins? No way, Rimmer. Not twins.

408
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:13,296
Oh, yes! Big, bonny, strapping,
bouncing boys they were, as well.

409
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,372
Huge heads.

410
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,577
- It's changing colour!
- What colour?

411
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:20,811
- Yes it is, it's changing colour!
- Yeah, but what colour?

412
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,973
- Yes, it's changing colour!
- WHAT COLOUR?!

413
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:24,117
It's blue for not pregnant, right?

414
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,701
- Yes!
- Oh, good news, excellent news, Listie!

415
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:29,739
- Oh, thank God!
- I'm going to be an uncle.

416
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,059
# It's cold outside

417
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,939
# There's no kind of atmosphere

418
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:41,377
# I'm all alone, more or less

419
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,579
# Let me fly far away from here

420
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:47,414
# Fun, fun, fun

421
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:51,017
# In the sun, sun, sun

422
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:54,457
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

423
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,818
# Drinking fresh mango juice

424
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:01,178
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

425
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,935
# Fun, fun, fun

426
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:07,696
# In the sun, sun, sun

427
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:10,455
# Fun, fun, fun

428
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:14,614
# In the sun, sun, sun #
