for a bit of a shock, sir.

213

How come I'm not dead?

Well, I've injected a home-made
MTK chip into your blood stream, sir,

228
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
which performs a function

229
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,560
similar to the old dialysis machine
of days gone by.

was clearly some

Mr Rimmer and I, however,

242
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,080
managed to obtain the services
of a state-of-the-art medi-bot.

(SNACKY BEEPING)

244

He's a state-of-the-art medi-bot?

245
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,200
He's only got four buttons!

246
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,440
He goes by the name of Asclepius.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,560

00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,320
Just one moment, Asclepius.

Or should that be, Mr Asclepius?

252
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,120
Pardon my faux pas, Professor.

253
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Now, where was I?

254
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
One of Asclepius' many abilities
is DNA rewriting.

255
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,880
If Mr Cat were willing
to donate one of his kidneys,

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,960
Asclepius here could make
his kidney compatible with your body.

257
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
This is the Cat we're talking about.

258
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,600
The one with the big,
black bog brush on his head!

259
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,760
You're expecting me
to ask him for a kidney?

260
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,120
He's never given anyone
anything in his life.

261
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
Well, when we explain the importance,

262
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,640
the idea of him being
a donor might appeal.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,840
Kryten, read the "Cat" dictionary.

264
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
There's only one meaning for donor.

265
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,280
A kind of kebab.

266
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,520
He's a cat, he can't help himself.

267
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
He has his selfish side,

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,840
but if it wasn't for you,
sir, he wouldn't exist.

269
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
Neither would his species.

270
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Plus, sir, you're buds.
He'll come through.

271
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Of course, he will.

272

- What have they told you?
- What's to tell?

279
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
We all got out in one piece, right?

280
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Right.

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,760
Erm, listen.
I've got a really big favour to ask you.

282
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,880
Go ahead, ask.

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,720

I just need a main course.

290
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,760
And get me one of those drip things,
like he's got.

- Listen, Cat.
- You wanted to ask me something.

Yeah, look.
I'm not gonna beat about the bush here.

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,680
I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

296
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
I'm not gonna beat about the bush.

298
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,160

In a minute.

300
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
I need you to...

301
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,440
...give me...

302
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,640
...one of your kidneys.

303
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160

So, let me get this straight.

309
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
I give you one of my kidneys,
what do I get?

310
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
A hole.

311
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,360
Where your kidney used to be.

312
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,200
So, I give you a kidney,
you give me a hole?

313
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
You keep the kidney, I keep the hole?

314
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,000
My gift to you.

315
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll tell you what.

316
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,240
It's not your kidneys
that need replacing.

317
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
It's your damn brain.

318
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,480
Cat, if you don't give me
your kidney and I die,

319
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
think how you'll feel.

320
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Better than you!

321
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,160

I think this is all front from you.

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,720
It's just all front.
''Cause I know you. I know you.

And when push comes to shove,
you'll do what's right.

324
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,440
I won't do what's right.

325
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,520

she was gone.

I confess, I was sceptical at first.

Oh, by the way,

I thought about what you said
about the kidney thing.

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,720

"What would you do
if this whole situation was reversed?"

I'd give you a kidney
in 10 seconds flat.

Mr Lister who had no kidneys,

who had no kidneys, sir!

I'm going to have to get myself
a kidney then, but where?

how come you're not dead?"

431

Well, then I went and looked
at the medi-results again.

I hadn't made a mistake after all.

in order to create a portal
back into the past.

with his colleagues,

refused to believe him

and stabbed him to death.

He realised
what a terrible thing he'd done,

477

to warn his younger self,

Could we use his research somehow?

You mean use Romero's configuration
to go back in time,

and take the younger Mr Lister's kidneys
and insert them into you, sir.

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,600
Not if we insert an MTK chip in him,

484
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,800
to keep him going until
he turns from younger Mr Lister

485
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,240
into present-day Mr Lister.

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
How can you nick my internal organs
with me not noticing?

487
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,280
We'd chloroform you, swipe your kidneys
and then you wake up feeling groggy,

black-out drunk, which you did.

489

LISTER: You know, that's right.

490
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,120
I blacked out
and then spent two days in bed

491

feeling like the living dead,
no offence.

492
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,200
And I couldn't understand it,

493
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,120
'cause I could only remember
having two drinks.

494
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
But it wasn't that,
it was 'cause I had no kidneys,

495
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,160
and only had the MTK chip
keeping me alive!

496
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,400
Do you know,
I believe we can do this, sir.

497
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
SNACKY: How?

498
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,560
No one knows how to reconfigure
the stasis booths.

499
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
What about you?

500
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,680
SNACKY: I'm a snack machine.

501
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,160
Did you overhear Romero when
he was talking about the adjustments?

502
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,160
SNACKY: But he only ever figured out
how to go back 30 years.

503
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,640
Going back just a few days
needs precision accuracy.

504
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
Well, you could build on his findings.

505
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,240
SNACKY: I'm just a snack dispenser.

506
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,000
I just dispense snacks.

507
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,640
But when we had our therapy sessions,

508
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
you taught me how to find
the hero inside myself!

509
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
SNACKY: No, I didn't.
And you know why?

510
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm just a snack dispenser.

511
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,800
Yes, you're just a snack dispenser,

512
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,520
if you think
you're just a snack dispenser.

513
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
But you're not only a snack dispenser,

514
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
you're something more if you decide
you want to be something more.

515
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
You taught me that in our first session!

516
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,040
SNACKY: I didn't teach you anything!
You know why?

517
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,920
Me, me, me, me! I got this one!

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,160
Is it 'cause you're a snack dispenser?

Let me ask you a few questions.

522
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,920
How do you unify the triode valve?

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,160
SNACKY: You reduce
the transmogulator setting.

524
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,320
Yes!

525
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
Did you know that?

526
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
No, it's just a long word.
It's good enough for me.

527
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,640
What does GFR stand for?

528
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,560
SNACKY: "Gyrospectic Functioning Rate."

529
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
You're right.

530
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,120
Perhaps, I can do this.

531
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,960
Okay, get me
to the nearest stasis booth.

SNACKY: There.

534
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,400
That should do it.

535
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Right, then, let's do this.

536
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,920
Oh, before we do.
Can I have a bag of Twirly Whirlers?

We've got to return that Lister
to the sleeping quarters,

549
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
and then get this Lister
back to the present.

in the science room

It's crucial we're not discovered
by our old selves.

travel faster than you.

Don't tell him anything.
You'll blow the timeline.

How can you fire a lift?

576
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
What is wrong with him?
He's a total gimboid.

577
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,520
Look, I'll make it right
when I'm back in the present.
