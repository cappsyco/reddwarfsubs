Stand by. She's coming round.

There's something out there, man. Some kind of UFO.
We're clamping on.

(WHIRRING)

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,870
- What are you all looking at me like that for?
- You've just unplugged the console!

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
That's right. I'm blow-drying my hair.

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,350
- We are tracking a UFO.
- Oh, you're tracking a UFO,

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,433
so I have to sit around looking
like the Bride of Frankenstein?

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,996
- Use another socket.
- This is beyond belief.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,994
A spaceship five miles long and it don't fit
enough plug sockets in the scanning room!

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,237
There's plenty of plug sockets
in the scanning room, Cat.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,950
They're all taken up with your
beauty aids. Now, use a wall socket.

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,438
What?! Unplug my hot wax strip
unsightly hair remover?!

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,952
Yes. Unplug your hot wax strip
unsightly hair remover!

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,151
I don't believe this.

We finally get to encounter an alien species,
and have to meet them with a wavery bikini line!

It's back, bearing zero-niner-zero.
Adjust 1% portside.

(LISTER) What the hell is it?

27
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:25,676
I've no idea, sir. The craft does
not appear to be of Earth construction.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,975
- Aliens. They're probably going to return Glenn Miller.
- What?

29
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,549
That's what they do. All those people
who inexplicably vanish, they return them.

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,636
Ah, smeg! That's all we need. Glenn Miller on
board boring us to death with "Pennsylvania 6-5000".

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,235
Kryten, open communication channels.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,353
(RIMMER) We don't want him! Go away!

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,672
You took him. You can keep the smegger!

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,393
How deliciously bizarre. The hall's molecular
structure conforms to no known element.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,714
Whoever or whatever made this thing
had access to a technology far in advanced of our own.

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,912
- OK, look, let's split up.
- Why? Why should we split up?

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,617
Well, we'll do the search quicker.

38
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:12,837
What's the hurry? Have you got some major
luncheon appointment you have to rush off to?

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,600
- What's your problem?
- I'm not teaming up with him.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,997
- Me? What's wrong with me?
- You're totally egocentric,

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,879
you flee at the first sign of trouble,
you only look after number one

42
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,997
you're vain, you're selfish, you're narcissistic and you're self-obsessed.

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,191
You just listed my all my best features.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,392
- I'm going with Kryten.
- Come on, Cat.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,103
Er, Kryten, you take point.
I've seen those movies.

46
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,589
It's always the guy in the lead who
buys it first. You take the front.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,445
Well, if it's movies we're talking about, sir.
In my experience it's usually the poor fellow

48
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,153
who's bringing up the rear
gets who gets picked off first,

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,709
so the others aren't aware they're under attack.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,272
You're right, you're right. Can you take the front
and the back, so I can go in the middle?

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,556
I'll do my best, sir.

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
- Go, Kryten.
- We've found something, sir.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,400
- Yeah?
- I think it's one of the crew.

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,270
A hideously malformed triple-headed skeleton
with putrefied flesh hanging from it.

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,512
it fell through Rimmer as we opened the lift door.

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,436
- Is he all right?
- I believe he's just discovered what shirt tails are for.

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,470
(RIMMER) All right, Kryten. You don't have to make me sound
like a complete cowardly gimboid git. I'm fine now.

58
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,679
(KRYTEN) So, shall I cancel the order
to find your mother?

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,878
- (RIMMER) Is that thing still on?
- Hey, look at this.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,212
Don't mess around with that, man.
We don't know what it does.

61
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,869
I'm just taking a look.

62
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,759
Cheers, man! Brilliant, I'm trapped!

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,480
- Get me out of this thing.
- Be cool, stay slinky.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,234
I'm on the case, here. I remember the sequence.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,916
It was red-blue-yellow... No, blue-yellow-red.

66

(GARBLED ELECTRONIC VOICE)

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,149
What the smeg is that?!

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,070
Curious, the skeletal form appears
to be basically humanoid in structure.

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,556
He's got three heads!

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,994
Wait. Here's some kind of wallet.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,154
The artefacts are human. A pilot's licence,
ID, even a video club card.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,591
Are you telling me this guy belonged to a video club
and he needed a card so they'd recognise him?

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,151
He's got six eyes and three noses.
If it were me, I'd remember him.

74
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,598
"Aren't you the bloke who came in last week,
sneezed and caused a monsoon?"

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,957
I think we can assume, he started out as human
and something happened here.

76
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,158
Something that mutated him in this unspeakable way.

handle this on my own?

84
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,431
I have to rush off and get
Novelty-Condom-Head to bail you out?

85

I got you into this, I'll get you out.

Just press the pads, any pads! Stop this!

(CLUCKS)

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,638
Are you OK? We detected a
massive power surge in this sector.

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,950
Where's Lister?

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,598
- That's Lister?!
- What can I say, except... whoops?

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,270
- What is it?
- Best guess? Some kind of DNA modifier,

97
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,273
designed to alter organic life at its molecular level.

98
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,750
This would explain our
triple-headed friend back there.

99
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,834
- So what does it do?
- Every single cell in your body contains DNA,

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,231
which is a series of genetic instructions
telling your body how to grow.

101
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,713
It's like a small computer program that chooses
the colour of your eyes, tells your nose what shape to be,

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,436
designates your sex, your height,
everything. Even your lifespan.

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,240
This machine simply rewrites the DNA program.

104
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,438
So this machine can transform any living thing
into any other living thing, by altering its molecular structure?

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,598
- Precisely.
- And it turned Lister into a chicken.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,350
- So it seems.
- Question is, can we turn him back again?

107
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,116
The question is, do we want to?

108
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,676
Hypothetically, it shouldn't be too difficult
to recall his original form.

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,354
It's simply a question of decoding the keypad.

110
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,279
Listy? (CLUCKS)

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,117
It's incredible. It really is him.
Look, it's even got his little beer gut.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,237
Hmm, seems a fairly straightforward
hexadecimal layout.

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,869
Logically, this should be the recall sequence.

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,916
(KRYTEN) That's not it, is it?

115
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,309
Let's start from the top.
What happened here, exactly?

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,479
I was pressing the pads.
I definitely pressed the yellow one first.

117
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,076
And then this thing came down.
So, I'm standing here pressing the buttons,

118
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,591
- then this voice said...
- Transmogrification sequence engaged.

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,515
Right! So I press some more buttons,
and then it says...

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,350
- Please key in new genetic structure.
- That's it exactly!

121
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,837
- Cat, stop!
- There's no need to engage your panic chip, sir.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,119
The machine can only operate on organic life.
I am mineral and therefore immune.

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,030
New genetic structure accepted,
Metamorphosis in ten seconds and counting.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,354
Oh. Wait a minute. No. My brain is part organic,

125
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,117
and therefore it is entirely possible for the machine
to transmogrify my physical condition.

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,511
Engage panic circuits... Panic circuits engaged.

127
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,239

128
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,111
(BLEEPING)

129
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,355
- (RIMMER) Are you OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,679
 - What was it like being a hamster?
- It was better than being a chicken.

131
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,470
Have you seen the size of an egg?
Have you seen the size of a chicken's bum?

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,265
That's what the
clucking was about.

133
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,840
I was trying to say in chicken talk
"For God's sake, give me a epidural!”

134
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,035
Let's get Kryten back.
Press what you pressed for Lister.

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,118
My heavens.

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,470
I am human.

137
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,151
Yeah, but you lost your looks.

138
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,071
I'm human - my greatest dream come true.
For the first time in my life, I can experience real feelings.

139
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,358
I'm experiencing one now. I'm in happiness mode.

140
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,909
I've never experienced anything like it before.

141
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,359
Oh, except for that one time when I accidentally welded
my groinal socket to a front loading washing machine.

142
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,954
I'm alive!

143
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,196
- How's he doing, Hol?
- Physically, he's fine.

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,638
He's got the body of a perfectly normal
30-year-old human male... apparently.

145
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,438
Is he all right?

146
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:23,718
It'll take a little while to adjust.
Everything's a bit new.

147
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,807
Da-da-da-da!!!

148
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:34,755
Greetings, fellow human. Ah, breakfast, my very
first meal. Boiled chicken ovulations - delicious!

149
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,271
- How you coping, man. Any problems?
- Well, just one or two.

150
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,909
In fact, I've compiled a little list if you'll indulge me.

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,793
Now, then, my optical system
doesn't appear to have a zoom function.

152
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,451
No, human eyes
don't have a zoom.

153
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:52,596
Well then, how do you bring
a small object into sharp focus?

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,196
Well, you just move your head
closer to the object.

155
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,797
I see. Move your head
closer...hmm...to the object.

156
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,270
Hmm, All right, OK. What about other optical effects,

157
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,636
like split screen, slow motion, Quantel?

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,156
- No. We don't have them.
- You don't have them? Just the zoom.

159
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,360
No, that's fine. That's great.
No, that's really great, that's great.

160
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,080
Now, then, er... my nipples don't work.

161
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,711
In what way "don't work"?

162
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,949
Well, when I was a mechanoid,
the right nipple nut was used to regulate body temperature,

163
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,990
while the left nipple nut was used mainly
to pick up short-wave radio transmissions.

164
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,439
Now, what I'm saying is that no matter how hard
I twiddle it, I can't seem to pick up Jazz FM.

165
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,956
- Human nipples don't do that, Kryt.
- I see. Fine.

166
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,679
Ah, recharging.

167
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,993
Now, I presume that a human wants to recharge,
they do it much the same way mechanoids do.

168
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,232
Indeed, I have located what I
presume to be the recharging socket,

169
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,316
but for some strange reason, it doesn't appear
to have the standard three-pin adaption.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,257
Now, do I have to use some
kind of special adaptor? Because

171
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:09,754
no matter what I do, the
lead just keeps falling out.

172
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,550
Kryten, we eat and sleep.
That's our way of recharging.

173
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,194
Oh. Hmm...

174
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,936
Ah, yes. Now, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

175
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,198
Something about er... well something I know that
we humans get a little embarrassed about.

176
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,560
It's a bit of a taboo subject, not the sort of thing we
like to sit around and chat about in polite conversation.

177
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,549
Kryten, I'm an enlightened 23rd-century guy.
Spit it out, man.

178
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,151
Well, I want to talk to you about my penis.

179
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,149
I knew it. You've gone straight into smirk mode.

180
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,082
Aren't we both two human adults?

181
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:55,030
Can't we discuss our reproductive
system without adolescent sniggering?

182
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,912
- Yeah, of course we can.
- Thank you.

183
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,356
- Well?
- Well-well-what?

184
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,526
Well, what do you think?

185
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,269
I'm not quite with you here,
Kryten. What am I supposed to say?

186
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,073
I want to know, is that normal?

187
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,559
What, taking photographs of it and showing it to your mates? No, it's not!

188
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,120
Well, but is it supposed to look like that?

189
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,080
- Well, yeah.
- It's hideous!

190
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,669
That's the best design they could come up with?!

191
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,913
Are you seriously telling me there were choices,
and someone said, "Ah, there that's it.

192
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,597
"That's the shape we're looking for,
the last-chicken-in-the-shop look?"

193
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,871
Shakespeare had one? Einstein?

194
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,750
Perry Como sang "Memories Are Made Of This"
with one of those stashed in his slacks?

195
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,634
- Well, yeah.
- No wonder humans don't have a zoom mode. Ugh.

196
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,791
Now, take a look at this.

197
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,751
And this.

198
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,034
Now, why do you suppose that happened?

199
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,914
Wh-what were you thinking of at the time?

200
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,920
Nothing in particular, sir. I was just idly flicking
through an electrical appliance catalogue.

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,392
I came across the section
on super deluxe vacuum cleaners

202
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,873
and suddenly my underpant elastic
was catapulted across the medical bay.

203
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,238
You see, man,
you're neither one thing or the other.

204
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,149
You shouldn't be getting erotic thoughts
about electrical appliances.

205
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,679
It WAS a triple-bag easy-glide vac with
turbo suction and a self-emptying dustbag.

206
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,914
Kryten, I don't care what model it was.

207
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,836
No vacuum cleaner
should give a human being a... double Polaroid.

208
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,793
- Do yourself a favour, man. Change back.
- Back?

209
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,272
Become one of those poor sappy,
sad-act mechanoids again? This is my dream.

210
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,471
Hey, listen, listen. I've got a joke for you.

211
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,513
Now, how many mechanoids
does it take to change a light bulb?

212
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,749
- I don't know.
- Twelve. And you know why?

213
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,276
- Why?
- Because they're so stupid! (LAUGHS)

214
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,431
Isn't that the greatest joke?

215
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,150
I've got another one.
Ever heard about the mechanoid peeping Tom?

216
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,516
(LAUGHS)

217
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,712
(KRYTEN'S LAUGHTER ECHOES)

218
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,836
Man, this is a totally whacked-out idea.
It's never gonna work.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,995
That DNA machine can do anything. Why shouldn't it work?
The hard part was finding one of my dead cells.

220
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,431
You really think you can clone yourself
from your own dandruff?

221
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,077
Why not? Dandruff has DNA in it.
That machine has a clone facility.

222
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,398
But a man made from dandruff? It's never going to work.

223
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,554
The first time you take a shower with
medicated shampoo, you'll disappear.

224
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,110
I won't be made of dandruff.

225
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:01,079
My body will be recreated from the genetic
pattern contained in its structure.

226
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,999
- How's Kryten?
- Confused.

227
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,996
If he ever offers to show you his photo
collection, my advice is decline. Politely.

228
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,320
I bet he can't believe his luck. He's reached
the pinnacle of the evolutionary mountain. He's a human.

229
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,716
What's so big about being human?

230
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,072
Listy, don't knock it till you've tried it.

231
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,676
I just don't trust that machine, man.
Look, I know it's old-fashioned,

232
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,639
but I'm from the school who believe if God had intended us to fly,

233
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,599
he wouldn't have invented
Spanish air traffic control.

234
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,274
OK, that machine might be
able to cure diseases and stuff,

235
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,638
but you shouldn't use it to change you
into what you're not. You are what you are.

236
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,236
Wasn't it Descartes who said, "I am what I am"?

237
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,434
- No, it was Popeye the Sailor Man.
- Well, whoever it was, he was a hell of a philosopher.

238
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,594
And I think what he was trying to say
was, you got to stay true to what you are.

239
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh, here we go.
Typical knee-jerk techno-fear reaction.

240
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,789
That machine is the greatest single
technological advancement mankind has ever made.

241
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,156
Greater than fire, greater than the wheel.

242
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,670
What about the dude with three
heads, what happened to him?

243
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,838
- Well, he abused it.
- Right, yeah. Someone always does.

244
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,569
Are you two seriously suggesting
you're not going to use it?

245
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:14,035
There's nothing about your
bodies you'd like to improve?

246
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,350
Me?! Are you serious? Most people
leave their bodies to medical science.

247
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,194
I'm leaving mine to the Louvre, baby!

248
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,597
At some point in their lives,
most people wish they were someone else.

249
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,599
This is going back years, years before the accident.

250
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,758
Kochanski had just finished with
me, and I was feeling really pony.

251
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,040
So I went for a walk in the botanical gardens and saw this
squirrel, climbing up and down the tree collecting nuts.

252
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,194
It stopped and it looked at me,
and I thought, "You lucky little sod.

253
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,950
"You like your job. You're your own
boss, and you've got no woman trouble.

254
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,231
So, you'll never feel
as bad as I feel, now.”

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,404
And at that moment, and
for a split second I would

256
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,678
have given anything, anything
to swap places with him.

257
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,591
Yeah, that's awful, man - when a woman screws
you up so bad you want to become a squirrel.

258
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,591
It just made me think that a lot of time,
that being human isn't much fun.

259
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,270
So, Lister, what are you telling us?
You're a closet squirrel?

260
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,469
Behind closed doors, you parade up and down
with a strap-on bushy tail calling yourself Nutkin?

261
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,198
What I'm telling you Rimmer, is that being human
sometimes isn't all it's cracked up to be.

262
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,515
And if Kryten thinks it'll solve all his problems, then
he's in for a major, I repeat, major disappointment.

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,670

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,519

We found this machine and it's made me human.

265
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,799
- You're a human now?
- That's right, Spare Head One.

266
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,634
Our wildest, most incredible
dream has come true.

267
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,832
- What's it like?
- It's indescribable, Spare Head Two.

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,550
True, I'm having a few problems
coping with the human emotions,

269
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,916
there's no zoom, the nipples don't work,

270
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,517
and I could show you a snapshot of something
that would make your eyes spin like fruit machines.

271
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,559
- But that apart, it's all going well.
- What about us?

272
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,998
- It was my turn to be main head next month.
- Well, obviously that's no longer possible.

273
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,516
Aren't you happy for me? I'm not a mechanoid.
I'm not second-class any more.

274
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,231
What about Spare Head Three?
You can't just leave him here. He's got droid rot.

nervous system, and his poncey new eight-valve heart,

do you know about anything?

286

you came into this world as a mechanoid,
and a mechanoid you'll always be!

I don't even know why I came
here. What a waste of time.

Oh, "Fellow human.”
How hollow those words sound now.

of these human emotions.

I'm miserable. What's wrong with me?

Yeah. You've had your head
up your recharge socket.

Agreed. And you've known all along.

Yeah, well. I did something similar once. Sold out.

OK, Kryten?

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,794
Once, many years ago...

310
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,395
I went into a wine bar.

311
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,919
- That's it? You went into a wine bar?
- OK. Keep it down, keep it down!

312
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,996
- I don't want the whole world to know.
- Well, what's so bad about going into a... WB?

313
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,271
It means I was a class traitor.

314
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,070
I could have been on that slippery slope -
hankering after pine kitchens,

315
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,358
sleeping on futons, eating tapas.

316
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,793
Who knows where it could have led.

317
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:48,310
I could have started having "relationships"
with people instead of "going out” with them.

318
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,950
Got married. Got on the property ladder.

319
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,589
God Almighty, who knows where it could have ended?

320
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,550
Next thing you know, I'm playing squash
every Tuesday night with a bloke called Gerald.

321
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,757
A lucky escape, man. Lucky escape

322
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,430
I've been thinking, sir. I want to be a mechanoid again.
It's what I always have been, what I always will be.

323
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,233
And no bad thing. Let's do it.

324
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,593
Kryten, there was a cartoon character once called Popeye,
said a really profound thing.

325
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,952
- What did he say?
- He said "I am what I am.”

326
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,720
Are you sure? I always thought that was Descartes.

327
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,835
So did I, man.
It's so easy to get those two dudes mixed up.

328
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,720
- (LISTER) What do you reckon, Hol?
- I reckon I've got it sussed.

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,355
- I reckon we should try it first.
- What with?

330
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,632
- Well, just need anything organic.
- Hey, don't look at me.

331
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,912
- I'm not looking at you. I'm looking at that foil container.
- Lister's curry?!

332
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,159
It's dead, it's organic. If we can change
a mutton vindaloo into a chicken vindaloo,

333
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,351
we'll know it's safe for Kryten.

334
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,234
Nice idea, Goalpost-Head.

335
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,870
- Let's try it.
- I was enjoying that!

- What have we created?

339

(LISTER) We've created the mutton vindaloo beast!
Half man, half extra-hot Indian curry!

340
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,317
OK. You go. I'll cover you.

341

- No!

I don't believe I'm running away
from a psychopathic curried man!

344
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,151
- Is he still following us?
- Can't you smell him? He's right behind us!

345
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,789
Remember last Easter? Twelve months ago to the day, The Polymorph?

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,594
That's right. You were attacked by a killer shami kebab.

347
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,394
How can the same smeg
happen to the same guy twice?

348
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,230
Last time, it was hors d'oeuvres.
This time, it's lunch.

Go back through there. The DNA suite, I've got an idea!

352
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,503
Holly, I'm only going to ask you
this the once, and I want the truth -

353
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,950
Can you make this
machine work without any mistakes?

354
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,436
Yeah. I know what I did wrong last time.

355
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,911
It's a mistake any deranged,
half-witted computer could've made.

356
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,994
- Look, I can do it. Give me a chance.
- Holly, that creature's virtually indestructible.

357
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,959
There's only one way to beat it.

358
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,158
Turn me into a superhuman. Man plus.

359
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,991
Are you totally insane?

360
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,630
You're letting that fruitbat of a computer
diddle with your DNA?

361
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,835
- Have you got a better plan?
- Maybe some Indian restaurant music will mollify it.

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,550
Or perhaps we could make a
surrender flag out of flock wallpaper.

363

through that door any minute now.

- Kind of.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

370
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,316
I mean “kind of".

371
