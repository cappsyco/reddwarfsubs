("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,351
How are you feeling, Mr Lister?

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,319
(WEARILY) Oh, much better, thanks, Kryten.

4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,673
- Much, much better.
- Well, you certainly look better, far better.

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,117
I can't believe how much
the swelling's gone down overnight.

6
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,616
Do you reckon?

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,552
Oh, definitely. It was almost interfering
with the ceiling fan yesterday afternoon.

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,839
You're nearly back to your old old self. In
fact, you can hardly tell you've got space mumps at all.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,478
So, when can I have a mirror?

10
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:15,591
Ah, I don't think we're
quite ready for a mirror just yet, sir.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,633
Let's take it one step at a time, shall we?

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,912
Oh, there, what did I tell you? It's gone down
eight inches overnight. You'll be up and about in no time.

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,696
I don't know what I'd have done
without you these last three weeks, Kryten.

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,473
You're like Florence
Nightingdroid.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,318
- Did you bring my breakfast?
- Yes, sir. Hot lager with croutons. Just the way you asked.

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,639
You certainly find out who your mates are
when you've got an unsightly disfiguring ailment.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,390
- I wouldn't say unsightly, sir.
- Get out of town, Kryten.

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,076
I've got a head like a hot-air balloon.
I look like the Human Light Bulb.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,124
And how many times
have they visited me?

20
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:55,031
How many times have they dropped by with
a word of comfort or a bunch of grapes?

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,471
It's just not been possible, sir.
Mr Rimmer has been on vacation.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,429
Vacation? The world's most charismatic man?
Where did he go?

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,069
He's been on a rambling holiday through the diesel decks.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,239
A ten-day hike through the ship's
combustion engines with two of the skutters.

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,155
- He said he'd pop by later and show you the slides.
- He didn't, did he?

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,990
Well, he's been loading the
projection carousel for 24 hours now, sir.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,191
We've got to stop him!

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,433
A slide show of the diesel decks -
that could really finish me off.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,750
I would have thought the Cat
would have dropped in though.

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,713
Well, he's been preoccupied of late
what with all this pod business.

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,431
Oh, screw down my diodes and call me Frank!
I wasn't supposed to mention that.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,698
What pod?

33
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,918
Oh! Now you're not well, sir.
Now, just forget I mentioned it.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,793
Come on, Kryten. What pod?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,392
Ohh... Yesterday evening, we came across
an escape pod floating in the local asteroid belt.

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,315
It contains the survivor of some space crash,
apparently cryogenically frozen.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,912
- Oh, yeah?
- All the signs are she's in a suitable condition for revival.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,909
- She?
- As far as we can tell, she's a she, yes.

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,198
That's just great, isn't it? That's just typical.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,960
The first female company in three million years,

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,112
and I look like something that belongs up a whale's nose.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,392
- Smeg!
- You can't get up, sir! What are you doing?

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,716
What do you think I'm doing?
There's a woman on board!

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,110
I'm on the cop.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,510
- So, who is she, Holly?
- It says on the pod, 'Barbra Bellini.'

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,638
Barbra Bellini. What a beautiful name.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,634
There's no justice. How could this happen to me?

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,639
Maybe, I could wear a turban
and pretend I'm from India.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,593
Maybe you could stick a spike in your
head and pretend you're the Taj Mahal.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,236
Oh, it's you.
Well, thanks for visiting me, man. Thanks a lot.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,751
Look at you. You know what
you look like? It's nauseating.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,039
You could go double-dating with the Elephant Man
and *he* would be the looker.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,266
- Why isn't this activated?
- What?

54
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,155
How come no-one started up the thaw process.

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,240
- I thought Alphabet-Head did it.
- So, who is she, man? Where's she from?

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,398
Who cares? At last... a date.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,618
Who says she's gonna
be interested in you?

58
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,116
I see what you're saying.

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,079
All this time alone in deep space
could have driven her insane, right?

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,716
No. Say she's just an ordinary
person, who doesn't go for your type?

61
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,958
I'd have heard about her! She would've appeared in "Ripley's Believe It Or Not".

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,879
- Well say she's interested in somebody else?
- Like who?

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,034
I dunno. Like... Well, like me?

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,073
You've got a head like like a watermelon.
What you gonna do?

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,154
Paint it with yellow and black stripes and
tell her you play quarterback with the Bengals?

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,279
I just think you're a little bit cocky for a guy
who's never actually met a real woman before.

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,112
I've seen mirrors. I have eyes.
Let's face it, buddy, I have a body that makes men wet.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,932
- Have you ever heard of an animal called an Iranian jird?
- No.

69
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,752
It can do 150 pelvic
thrusts a second.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,790
- So?
- That's me in slo-mo.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,796
Put a Black & Decker drill on the end,
and I can make it through walls, boy!

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,471
Listy, what are you doing up?

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,389
Shouldn't you be in the greenhouse
with the rest of the cantaloupes?

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,638
- Who started the RP?
- He did.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,872
You simple-minded gimboid.
Didn't I tell you to leave this to me?

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,594
Look, what's the problem?
She's in there, let's get her out.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,159
The problem, Pussy Cat Willum,
is this capsule was ejected from a prison ship,

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,755
a prison ship on which the convicts mutinied.

79
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,791
There was a pitched battle with only two survivors:
one prisoner, one guard - the erstwhile Ms Bellini.

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,634
One of those two got into this pod and escaped.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,237
But, of course, you'll know all of this having familiarised
yourself thoroughly with the black box recording.

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,877
- So, if it's not Bellini in there, then who is it?
- One of the prisoners.

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,954
And considering
that ship was transporting 40 psychotic,

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,839
half-crazed, mass-murdering, super-strong androids,

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,913
we thought it prudent to find out who the
smeg was in there before we woke them up!

86
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,316
With respect, sir, they're not androids.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,756
- They're simulants.
- What's the difference?

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,994
Well, the basic difference is that an android would never rip off a human's head and spit down his neck.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,071
- Can we stop it, Hol?
- What? Oh, no. One-way process.

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,539
Well, can't we find out who's
in there by X-raying the pod?

91
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:07,634
No. Lead lining. Has to
survive in space, dunnit?

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,196
- There must be some way of finding out.
- Well, there is.

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
All we have to do is hang around here for 24 hours.

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,804
Then, if you find your limbs scattered around
deep space and your neck full of saliva,

95
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,917
you can take it as read, it probably wasn't Babs.

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,876
Why not tool up with bazookoids,
wait for the pod to open,

97
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,670
and if it's one of these bad-ass
android dudes, let it eat laser?

98
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,917
Simulants are virtually indestructible, sir.

99
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,551
It could easily withstand a volley of bazookoid
fire at close range with only minimal damage.

100
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,600
It would certainly survive long enough to make
balloon animals out of your lower intestines.

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,077
Well, I see no other option.
Let's blast it back into space.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,549
Hang on! Say it isn't the simulant?
You can't just shoot an innocent woman into space.

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,317
What a dilemma!
Inside this pod is either death or a date.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,316
Personally, I'm prepared to take the risk.

105
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,038
Meanwhile, the pod is defrosting, and
we haven't decided what to do. Holly, any ideas?

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,159
Right. Here's a
possibility: the black box.

107
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:08,758
Contains the coordinates of the penal
colony the prison ship was heading for.

108
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,594
- So?
- Well, there's bound to be facilities there

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,797
to contain any hostile life form.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,395
If it's turns out to be Bellini, we release her.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,632
If it's the simulant, we can bung him in the cell and leave him to rot.

112
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,151
IF the colony's still there, and IF it's still operational.

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,911
There's an old android saying which I believe
has particular relevance here it goes like this:

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,835
"If you don't gosub a program loop,
you'll never get a subroutine."

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,556
Yeah, we have a human expression which is pretty similar:
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

116
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,593
Oh no, I think the android one is punchier.

117
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,231
- Do you have to sit up here?
- It's warmer in the front. It helps my gunge.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,392
I can't see anything, your head keeps getting in the way of the mirror.

119
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,678
In fact, it keeps getting in the way of the windscreen.

120
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,831
Next! Ah, now, this one...

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,799
We reached this beauty on the
evening of the fourth day.

122
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,716
The Cameron Mackintosh
40-valve air-cooled diesel. The 184.

123
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,350
Almost identical to the 179,
but have you noticed the difference?

124
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,670
See the refinement in the funnel edges?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,790
I thought we're never get another chance to see one of these
so we bivouacked down for the night under the fuel pump.

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,349
There's a funny story about that, which I'll tell you later

127
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,037
but we're not going to get to any of the
class fives unless we push along. Next!

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,909
- Ah! Another favourite.
- Sir, can we take a break for a while?

129
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,993
It appears my intelligence circuits have melted.

130
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,313
We're not going to get through them all, Kryten, if we take a second break...

131
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,433
Sir, that's a gamble I'm willing to take.

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,910
Now, the class 40s, the first twin...

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,157
(SQUELCH)

134
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,040
Oh, my God!

135
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,399
His head burst!

136
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,349
That is better. That is so much better. I feel good!

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,234
Talk about a weight off your mind.

138
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,070
I don't want to live!
Someone, please... shoot me in the head!

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,433
- (LISTER) Is there anything down there, Hol?
- No life forms, not according to the heat scan.

140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,434
- Any mechanical intelligence?
- Yeah, mainframe's still operational.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,513
Just initiating interface...
Hang about. Here we go.

142
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,751
Getting a message.

143
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,911
(JUSTICE COMPUTER) Welcome to Justice World,

144
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,078
Please state your clearance code
and prison officer ident.

145
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,069
We're not a prison ship. We don't have a clearance
code. We just want to use your facilities.

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,954
- State life form inventory.
- Four.

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,475
One hologram, one mechanoid, two humanoid.

148
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,117
- Transfer ship navicomp to my jurisdiction.
- OK, guys.

149
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,477
On landing, please disembark and proceed
through the neutral area to the clearance zone.

150
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,079
Until you are granted a clearance code,
please observe all security requirements.

151
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,120
Your party will be met
by a consignment of escort boots.

152
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,112
Please step into the boots.

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,473
I'm supposed to wear these?!
These look like Frankenstein's hand-me-downs.

154
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,235
Haven't you got anything
with a Cuban heel or a crepe sole?

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,355
- I can't wear these. I'm a hologram.
- That has been accounted for.

(BOOTS WHIRR)

157
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,233
Now what?

(ELECTRONIC PULSE)

159
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,750
- Oh, God! What's this?
- Relax, sir. It's just a mind probe.

160
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,516
- Hang on a minute, what's a mind probe?
- The computer was just searching our minds,

161
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
presumably for any evidence of criminal activity, sir.

162
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,229
What do you mean, "criminal activity"?

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,273
I wouldn't worry about it, sir.
It's just a routine clearance procedure.

164
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,916
Yeah, yeah, but when you say "criminal activity",
what do you mean by "criminal activity"?

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,431
- I mean, how criminal do you mean by "criminal"?
- What are you bleating on about, Lister?

166
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,393
Just define "criminal activity" for me, that's all!

167
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,309
Well, imagine a situation where someone had
committed a crime and concealed it from the law,

168
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,674
the mind probe would be able to uncover that
crime and sentence that person accordingly.

169
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,520
Why did no one tell me this
before I put the smegging boots on?

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,556
Oh, Listy, Listy. Is that a small sewage plant
you're carrying in your trousers...

171
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,076
..or do I detect you're a tad concerned?

172
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,319
Well, come on, guys. Everyone's done something
in their past that's been a little bit illegal.

173
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,831
- I haven't. I never so much as got a parking ticket.
- Oh, smeggin' hell!

174
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,077
- What did you do?
- Well, like scrumping.

175
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,007
When I was a kid back in Liverpool,
we used to always go scrumping.

176
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,871
Oh, stealing apples?
That's hardly a crime, sir.

177
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,039
Yeah, but me and me mates,
we used to go scrumping for cars.

178
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,470
- Did you get caught?
- All the time, I was stupid.

179
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,990
Oh, there's no problem then, you've
already served your punishment.

180
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,879
There were other things as a kid, though.
Things that I didn't get caught for.

181
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,799
- Like what?
- Well, there was this one time at this hotel...

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,116
Oh, lots of people take towels from hotels, sir.

183
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,118
I took the bed.

184
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,238
I winched it out the
window to me mates outside.

185
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:17,513
I was renting this flat, you
see. It was unfurnished.

186
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,315
- You mean to say you went to a hotel and stole the bed?!
- I stole the entire room.

187
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,034
Absolutely despicable. You're a common thief.

188
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,804
I'm not making excuses,
but everyone was doing it.

189
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,235
I wasn't strong enough
to go against the flow.

190
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,752
- I would not like to be in your boots right now, buddy!
- Why? What do you think's going to happen to me?

191
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,079
Oh, don't worry about it, sir. I'm sure they're not
going to be interested in some minor misdemeanour

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,993
you committed as an adolescent
over three million years ago.

193
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,353
- Seriously, Kryten, do you reckon?
- Boy, I'm really getting the hang of this lie mode

194
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,511
That was totally convincing, wasn't it?

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,478
(JUSTICE COMPUTER)
The mechanoid Kryten - clearance granted.

196
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,870
You may go freely about the complex.

197
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,316

Hey, I hear they do good bread and water here, buddy.

200
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,635
The human known as Lister -
despite a number of petty criminal acts -

201
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,990
clearance granted.

202
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,790
The hologram known as Rimmer -

203
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,278
guilty of second-degree murder, 1,167 counts.

204
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,591
No. There must be some mistake, surely?

205
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,153
Each count carries a statutory penalty
of eight years' penal servitude.

206
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,675
In the light of your hologrammatic status,

207
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,354
these sentences are to be served consecutively,

208
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,755
making a total sentence of 9,328 years.

209
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,839
I've never so much as returned a library book late!
Second-degree murder?

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,356
A thousand people? 
I would have remembered!

211
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,196
Your wilful negligence
in failing to reseal a drive plate

212
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,829
resulted in the deaths of the entire crew

213
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,716
of the Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel
the Red Dwarf.

214
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,871
Oh, that.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,914
Sentence to commence immediately.

216
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,630
You are now leaving the neutral area
and entering the Justice Zone.

217
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,351
Beyond this point,
it is impossible to commit any act of injustice.

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
(RIMMER) Help!

219
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,992
Hi, killer.

220
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,075
- Nine thousand years. Nine!
- I brought you a book.

221
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,156
Oh, thanks. That'll really help the centuries fly past.

222
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,590
Don't panic, man. We're gonna get you out of here.

223
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,633
Why bother? I'll be up for parole
in another couple of ice ages.

224
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,310
Look, Kryten reckons you've got the Right of Appeal.
He's trying to put a case together right now.

225
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,838
This isn't a bad place for a prison. How come
there are no locks or bars or guards or anything?

226
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,274
There doesn't need to be. The whole prison complex is
covered by something called the Justice Field.

227
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,795
I had to sit through this tedious lecture.

228
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,351
Apparently, it's physically impossible
to commit any sort of crime here.

229
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,200
- What do you mean?
- Just try and commit a crime. You'll see.

230
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,235
- Well, like what?
- I don't know. Anything.

231
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,516
Arson. Try and set fire to those sheets.

232
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,874
- OK.
- Go on. Try it.

233
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,910
Whatever crime you try and commit,
the consequences happen to you.

234
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,837
Smeggin' hell!

235
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,870
Nice example, Rimmer! Nice example!

236
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,509
You could have just
explained that to me verbally.

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,716
It's the same with stealing. Same with everything.

238
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,919
Right, I'm with you. So if you nick something,
something of yours goes missing, yeah?

239
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,111
Right. Try it.

240
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,672
- No.
- You see? It's the perfect system.

241
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,785
It forces the inmates
to adhere to the law.

242
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,754
Once they get out, it's
become second nature.

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,032
Good news.
The justice computer has sanctioned a retrial.

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,880
I think we have a very strong case.

245
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,677
You do? It's simply a question of differentiating
between guilt and culpability, sir.

246
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,435
What the mind probe detected was
your own sense of guilt about the accident.

247
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,109
In a way, you tried and convicted yourself.

248
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,513
I simply have to establish that you're
a neurotic, under-achieving emotional retard

249
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,475
whose ambition far outstrips his miniscule ability

250
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,756
and consequently blames himself for an accident

251
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,230
for which he could not possibly have been responsible.

252
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,150
You're going to prove that I was innocent of negligence
on the grounds that I'm a halfwitted incompetent?

253
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,638
Man, there ain't a jury in the land
that wouldn't buy a plea like that!

254
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,876
Well, no. Not a halfwit, exactly... more a buffoon.

255
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,311
But how would you begin to build such a case?
Where would you conjur up the evidence?

256
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,115
Sir, providing I can have complete
free access to your personal data files,

257
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,591
I think I can come up with the outline of
a winning case by... lunchtime?

258
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,198
(KRYTEN) The mind probe
was created to detect guilt,

259
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,756
yet in the case of Arnold Judas Rimmer,

260
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,879
the guilt it detected attaches to no crime.

261
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,396
He held a position of little or
no importance on Red Dwarf.

262
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,559
He was a lowly grease monkey, a zero, a nothing,

263
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,912
a piece of sputum floating in the toilet bowl of life.

264
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,996
Yet, he could never come to terms
with a lifetime of underachievement.

265
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,477
His absurdly inflated ego would never permit it.

266
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,598
He's like the security guard on the front gate

267
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,229
who considers himself head of the corporation.

268
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,831
So, when the crew were wiped out
by a nuclear accident,

269
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,469
Arnold Rimmer accepted the blame.

270
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,031
It was his ship, ergo his fault.

271
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,153
I ask the court - look at this man,

272
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,396
this man who sat and failed
his astronavigation exam on 13 occasions.

273
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,195
This sad man, this pathetic man,
this joke of a man...

274
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,670
Kryten. You're going over the
top, the court will never buy it.

275
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,396
Sir, trust me. My whole case
hinges on proving you're a dork.

276
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,239
Understood.

277
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,875
I call my first witness.

278
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,510
- Name?
- Dave Lister.

279
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,757
Occupation?

280
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,878
Er, bum.

281
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
Would you describe the accused as a friend?

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,992
- Take the Fifth!
- Now, please answer the question.

283
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,757
Remember, you are under polygraphic surveillance.
Would you describe the accused as a friend?

284
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,429
No, I'd describe the accused as a git.

285
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,638
Who would you say then, is the person who thinks of him most fondly?

286
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,592
I do.

287
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,553
And are there no others who have
shared moments of intimacy with him?

288
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,354
Only one, but she's got a puncture.

289
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,639
Objection!

290
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,236
- (COMPUTER) Overruled.
- So, you wouldn't describe him as a man with a good social life?

291
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,196
No. He partied less than Rudolf Hess.
He was totally dedicated to his career.

292
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,319
He was in charge of Z shift, you see, 
and it occupied his every waking moment.

293
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,353
And what was Z shift's most important duty?

294
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,991
Well, we had a lot of important duties on the
ship but I guess our most vital responsibility

295
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,393
was making sure the vending machines
didn't run out of fun-size Crunchie bars.

296
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,953
Can you ever envisage a situation where
the lack of honeycomb-centred chocolate bars

297
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,829
might be the direct cause
of a lethal radiation leak?

298
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,996
Not off the top of my head, no.

299
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,030
You may sit down.

300
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,598
I ask the court one key question -

301
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,755
would the Space Corps ever
have allowed this man to be in a position of authority

302
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,514
where he might endanger the entire crew?

303
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,596
A man so petty and small-minded, he would
while away his evenings sewing name labels

304
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,718
onto his ship-issue condoms.

305
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,998
- A man of such awesome stupidity...
- Objection!

306
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,830
- Objection overruled.
- A man of such awesome stupidity,

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,356
he even objects to his own defence counsel.

308
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,160
An over-zealous, trumped up little squirt...

309
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,311
- Objection!
- Overruled.

310
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,229
An incompetent vending machine repairman
with a Napoleon complex

311
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,429
who commanded as much respect and affection
from his fellow crew members as Long John Silver's parrot.

312
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
Objection!

313
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,559
If you object to your own counsel once more,
Mr Rimmer, you'll be in contempt.

314
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,756
Who would permit this man, this joke of a man,
this man who could not outwit a used tea bag,

315
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,436
to be in a position where he
might endanger the entire crew?

316
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,513
Who? Only a yogurt.

317
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,473
This man is not guilty of manslaughter.

318
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,190
He is only guilty of being Arnold J Rimmer.

319
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,192
That is his crime. It is also his punishment.

320
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,910
The defence rests.

321
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,517
The verdict on the defendant will now be passed.
In view of your counsel's eloquent defence,

322
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,315
together with the reams of material
evidence he submitted on computer card.

323
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,233
this court accepts that, in your case,

324
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,359
the mind probe is not an adequate method
of ascertaining guilt.

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,031
It is not possible for you to have committed
the crimes for which you blame yourself

326
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,635
and you may therefore go free.

327
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,031
- Objection!
- Sir, what are you objecting to now?

328
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,918
I want an apology.

329
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,673
Brilliant, Kryten!
What can I say? You were brilliant.

330
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,869
You even had me believing it. The way you
twisted the facts to make them fit this pattern.

331
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,074
Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know what
made us want to come to this hellhole in the first place.

332
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,830
- I do.
- Hmm... Can I smell perfume?

333
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,796
- (GROWLS) I doubt it.
- Are you by any chance Barbra Bellini?

334
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,951
I didn't think so!

335
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,991
'Ere! What's going on?! Oh!

336
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,473
(CAT) Ugh! To think I caressed his pod!

337
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,275
You are now entering the Justice Zone.

338
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,355
Beyond this point, it is impossible
to commit any act of injustice.

339
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,070
You are now entering the Justice Zone.

340
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,757
Beyond this point, it is impossible
to commit any act of injustice.

341
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:05,076
(METAL CLINKS)

342
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,080
Hey, my friends... I don't want any trouble.

343
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,596
I just want your spacecraft.
Give me the start-up code.

344
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,558
Look. I have no weapon.

345
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,158
What are you waiting for? Gloop him.

346
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,789
I can't. He's not armed.

347
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,591
Lister, this is not a Scout meeting. We're not trying to win Best Behaved Troop flag. Gloop him.

348
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,270
- What? In the back?
- Of course in the back!

349
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,511
It's only a pity he's awake.

350
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,959
You mean you could happily
kill him if he was asleep?

351
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,398
I could happily kill him if he
was on the job. Gloop him.

352
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,158
It's immoral.

353
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,952
Come on, my friends.
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed droid.

354
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,476
Come out and let's discuss it.

355
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,511
I'm gonna go and talk to him.

356
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,593
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

357
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,278
- You have no weapons?
- No.

358
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,999
You have no weapon?

359
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,833
No.

360
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,830
Guess what.

361
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,953
I lied.

362
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,111
Guess what.

363
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,519
So did I.

364
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,078
But I lied...twice.

365
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,320
- I didn't think of that.
- I'm very glad you didn't.

366
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,275
- What do you want to talk about?
- Your death.

367
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,398
Your... imminent death.

368
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:18,936
Oh...

369
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,996
What the smeg is going on?!

370
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:31,896
Ugh!

371
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,559
(BUZZING)

372
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,153
- Yo, matey. Hit me on the head with this.
- Malfunction. Does not compute.

373
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,639
Mal...function. Mal...function.

374
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,400
(CHOKING)

375
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,149
I got him, buddy! Leave this to me!

376
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,072
Cat, no! No!

377
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,231
Better late than never.

378
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,470
(LAUGHS)

379
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,550
Makes you think though, doesn't it? I mean Mankind's
history has been one long search for justice.

380
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,365
That's what all
religions are about.

381
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,839
I mean, they accept life
as being basically unfair,

382
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,302
but promise that everyone
will get their just desserts later -

383
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,870
heaven, hell, karma,
reincarnation, whatever.

384
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,473
Those guys that built that
penal colony. They tried to bring

385
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:58,160
some order to the universe
by creating the Justice Field,

386
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,200
but when you live in an environment where justice does exist,
you have no free will.

387
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,874
That's why in our universe, you can never have true natural justice. guy.

388
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,832
Good things will happen to
bad people

389
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,920
and bad things will happen to good people.
It's the way it's gotta be.

390
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,356
Life by its very nature has to be cruel, unkind

391
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,318
and unfaaaaaair...!

392
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,835
Thank God for that.

393
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,031
# It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere

394
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,477
# I'm all alone, more or less

395
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,758
# Let me fly far away from here

396
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,594
# Fun, fun, fun

397
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,276
# In the sun, sun, sun

398
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,671
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

399
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,992
# Drinking fresh mango juice

400
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,391
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

401
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,200
# Fun, fun, fun

402
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,910
# In the sun, sun, sun

403
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,799
# Fun, fun, fun

404
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,349
# In the sun, sun, sun #
