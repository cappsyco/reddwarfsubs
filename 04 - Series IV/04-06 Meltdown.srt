00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,153
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,372
(RIMMER) ...So there we were
at 2.30 in the morning.

3
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:43,560
I was beginning to wish I had
never come to cadet training school.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,355
To the south lay water. There was no way we could cross that.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,876
To the East and West,
two armies squeezed us in a pincer.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,479
The only way was North. I had to go for it
and pray the gods were smiling on me.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,712
I picked up the dice and threw two sixes.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,271
Caldicott couldn't believe it.
My go again. Another two sixes!

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,317
Rimmer, what's wrong with you? Don't you realise that no
one is even slightly interested in anything you're saying?

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,471
You've got this major psychological defect

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,429
which blinds you to the fact
that you're boring people to death.

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,716
How come you can't sense that?

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,269
Anyway, I picked up the dice again...

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,750
Unbelievable! Another two sixes!

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,971
- Rimmer!
- What?

16
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:29,956
No one wants to know some stupid story about how you
beat your cadet school training officer at "Risk".

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,919
Then disaster! I threw a two and a three.

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,198
Caldicott picked up the dice and
threw snake eyes. I was still in it!

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,155
- Cat, can you talk to him?
- What?

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,480
Anyway, to cut a long story short, I threw a five and a
four, which beat his three and a two, another double six,

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,396
followed by a double four and a double five, after he'd thrown a three and a two. I threw a six and a three!

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,870
Man, this guy could bore for his country.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,839
What I wanna know is how the smeg can you remember what
dice you threw in a game you played when you were 17?

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,919
I jotted it down in my "Risk" campaign book.

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,778
I always used to do that.

26
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:11,919
So I could replay my moments of glory over
a glass of brandy in the sleeping quarters.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,404
I ask you, what better way is
there to spend a Saturday night?

28
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:16,438
You got me.

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,110
So, a six and a three and he
came back with a three and a two...

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,950
Rimmer, can't you tell the
story is not gripping me?

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,513
I'm in a state of non-grippedness.
I am completely smegging ungripped.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,751
Shut the smeg up!

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,355
Don't you want to hear the "Risk" story?

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,955
That's what I've been saying for the last 15 minutes.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,555
But I thought that was because I
haven't got to the really interesting bit?

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,839
- What really interesting bit?
- Ah! Well, that was about two hours later,

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,316
after he'd thrown a three and a
two and I'd thrown a four and a one.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,551
- I picked up the dice...
- Hang on a minute. Hang on...

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,142
The really interesting bit is
exactly the same as the dull bit.

40
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,510
You don't know what I did
with the dice though, do you?

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,824
For all you know, I could have
jammed them up his nostrils,

42
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,873
headbutted him on the nose and they
could have blasted out of his ears.

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,269
- That would've been quite interesting.
- OK. Rimmer... What did you do with the dice?

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,795
I threw a five and a two.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,710
- And that's the really interesting bit?
- Well, it was interesting to me, it got me into Irkutsk.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,871
Hmm... Curious.

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,319
Extraordinary!

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,279
What a truly copasetic piece of machinery.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,079
- What is it?
- Well, basically it appears to be a device

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,754
that converts an individual into digital information

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,800
and then transmits him as light beams
to another point in space.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,191
Essentially, it's a matter... transporter.

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,995
It's pretty neat... huh?

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,269
- Where'd you get it from?
- I think it must be a prototype.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
I found it in the research labs down on Z Deck.

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,279
I managed to cobble together the missing
circuitry and it appears to be fully functional.

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,319
Theoretically,
it can transport several people at once.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,313
Would you like to grip a paddle, sir?

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,198
we'll meet you by the navicomp in Starbug.

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,237
Let's go.

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,554
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I neglected to engage the depth function.

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,280
We'll walk, Kryten. we'll walk.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,755
So, besides cutting down on shoe leather,
what good is it?

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,634
Exploration. It can take you anywhere.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,118
It can home in on atmosphere-bearing planets
within a range of 500,000 light years.

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,830
If there are life forms in the local systems,
this thing will take you straight to 'em.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,429
So are there any planets with an atmosphere in range?

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,631
Several, according to
the paddle's scanners,

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,589
but the most interesting prospect
appears to be 200,000 light years away.

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,276
In the normal course of things, it would take
Starbug several billion years to reach it.

71
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,910
It wouldn't be so bad.
Rimmer could finish his "Risk" story.

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,759
Travelling sub-space via the paddle,
we would reach it almost instantaneously.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,270
- What are we waiting for?
- Hey, hey, hey!

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,592
- Nobody's rearranging MY molecules.
- It's perfectly safe, sir,

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,390
but I do suggest that Mr Rimmer
and I go on ahead as a scout party.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,318
What?!

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,233
Well, if the atmosphere isn't breathable,
we won't be affected.

78
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,755
If it is, we can send the paddle back to pick you up.

79
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,316
The thing is, Kryters, I'd love
to be in the advance scout party,

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,552
facing all those thrilling
unknown dangers with you.

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,271
Fighting a frontiersman's path through a jungle
of discovery, but you're forgetting one thing.

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,791
No, sir. I've taken your congenital
cowardice into consideration.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,197
I'm a hologram. I can't touch
the thing. How can it transport me?

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,119
Well, of course, you do have
a small physical presence.

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,958
Precisely.

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,838
- Holly, would you give me Mr Rimmer's light-bee, please?
- Wait a minute...

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,469
- (RIMMER SQUEAKS) Where am I?
- This is Rimmer?

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,679
(HOLLY) Yeah, it buzzes around inside him
and projects his image.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,670
My God! That was disgusting!

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,474
Please, sir, that's a very
sophisticated piece of hardware.

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,116
- Really? Anyone fancy a game of squash?
- Sir!

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,791
Thank you. Now, if all goes well,
the paddle will rematerialise here.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,074
Simply press this green key and you'll be transported
down to the planet, a safe distance from us.

94
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,108
(LISTER) OK.

95
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,876
- What is this place?
- Well, I can't pinpoint our location precisely,

96
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,793
but the atmosphere is indeed breathable.

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,951
I'll return the paddle.

98
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,838
- What now?
- Well, I suggest we start to run, sir.

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,954
I suggest we ambulate
as fast as the local gravity will allow.

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,112
- Why?
- Because of them, sir.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,673
Sir?

102
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,836
Must be safe. Let's go.

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,038
This will be ze final push, mein kamerads.

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,239
Their resources are poor. Zeir vill is veek!

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,711
We can crush zem.
We can grind zem into ze dirt!

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,875
We can chew up Zeir bodies
and spit zem out as if zey are sauerkraut!

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,398
Intruders! Seize zem!

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,559
So long...

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,474
...suckers!

110
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,351
Dummkopfs! Arrest zem!

111
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,916
- Get us out of here!
- Don't panic me, man. I'm doing my best!

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,631
- (CAT) Where are we?
- Don't know.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,271
Stone. We're in some sort of
narrow stone passageway.

114
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,195
- So what do we do?
- I can see daylight.

115
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,270
I dunno, we'll just hang around here I suppose,
till we work out where we are.

116
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,957
At least we're out of trouble.

117
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,111
Who were those guys?

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,999
The short one with the stupid 'tash was Hitler.

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,875
And the jerky one with the child
molester glasses was Goebbels.

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,232
I suppose the fat bastard must have been Goering.
Must have been.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,244
He was a cocaine addict and a transvestite.

122
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:08,872
Pity really, if things had worked out different
he had all the makings of a major movie star.

123
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,270
(OUTSIDE) Hands up, pig dogs!

124
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,637
- I think I've just worked out where we are.
- Get zat machine!

125
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,590
You seriously telling me he's a transvestite?

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,400
- Yeah.
- With those hips?!

127
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,339
I think we've lost them.

128
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:35,677
I can't believe how feeble and
improbable those creatures were, sir.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,993
I've seen more convincing dinosaurs given
away free with a packet of Wheaty Flakes.

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,436
There's something wrong here.

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,076
Reach for the sky, boys!
Thank you very much. Thank you.

132
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,553
Lets take it-a nice and easy. No funny business or
I splash-a your guts around like-a communion wine.

133
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,600
- OK, get moving. Thank you very much.
- Which way?

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,399
Thataway.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,426
What do you think these
guys are going to do to us?

136
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,394
Whatever it takes to find out about the paddle.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,911
Hey, if you mean torture,
then say the word "torture".

138
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,594
- I can take it.
- OK. They may torture us.

139
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,952
- (WAILS) Torture us!
- They probably won't, man.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,990
They're probably not interested in the paddle.
They'll probably just take us outside and... execute us.

141
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,352
You're just saying that to make me feel better.

142
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,349
It's just, those guys are fiends.
They instantly know your weak spots.

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,269
As soon as they see me, they'll know they only have
to force me into platform shoes and flared trousers,

144
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,590
and I'll sing like Tweety Pie.

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,314
Dunno what the smeg went wrong.

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Kryten never said anything about the paddle taking us back in time.

147
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,750
It was just supposed to transport us to the
nearest planet with a breathable atmosphere.

148
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,639
How the smeg did we wind up
in the middle of the Third Reich?

149
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,559
- (BANGING)
- What are those guys doing out there?

150
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,711
- Building something.
- What?

151
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,629
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Just a sculpture, you know. A modern art job.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,475
- Like the kind you get in shopping malls.
- What's it made of?

153
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,191
Wood. It's a sort of inverted L shape in wood.

154
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,519
Does it have a kind of rope motif?

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,833
There's a sort of noosey theme to it, yeah.

156
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,349
It's gallows, right?
Look, if it's gallows, say it's gallows.

157
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,194
- I can take it.
- OK, it's gallows.

158
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,391
(WAILS) They've built the gallows to hang us!

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,712
Look, man, don't panic. We're gonna escape!

160
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,871
- How?
- Just...

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,998
Hijack the guards when they come in,
nick their uniforms and stroll out.

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,273
Are you insane? You seriously expect me
to wear grey out of season?

163
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,035
- I'd rather hang.
- Hang on! Hang on! Something's happening.

164
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,754
Some kind of parade or drill, but...

165
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,634
- But what?
- Hang on.

166
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,715
These guys aren't Nazis.
They're all wearing different period costumes.

167
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,192
There's one that looks like Al Capone.
There's another like Mussolini.

168
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,510
Richard Ill, Napoleon...

169
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,754
Smeg! It's like all the worst people in history
have been brought together in one place.

170
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,309
Oh, my God! There's James Last!

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
I recognise him from Rimmer's record collection.

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,915
- What are they doing?
- Just lining up in... some kind of firing squad.

173
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,317
Whoa, whoa! Hang on! Someone's being brought out.

174
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,517
They're tying him to a stake.

175
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,316
It's Winnie the Pooh.

176
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,158
- What?!
- Winnie the Pooh, I swear!

177
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,429
He's refusing the blindfold.

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,189
- They're tying Winnie the Pooh to the stake?
- (GUNFIRE)

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,076
That's something no one should ever have to see!

180
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,830
My God, sirs! You may break our bones,
but you will never break our spirits!

181
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,475
Good day, good sirs.
The name's Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln.

182
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,916
We have to face facts - the war is lost.

183
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,356
(SQUEAKS) What are we gonna do?

184
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,754
I don't know. I still feel there's a solution
probably involving triangles.

185
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,078
Pythagoras, what is it with
you always, with the triangles?

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Your solution to everything is triangles!
There are problems in life that can't be solved with triangles.

187
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,154
Hey, we got us some prisoners.

188
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,439
Anybody got a burger? I haven't eaten
in five minutes. Thank you very much.

189
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,237
- Could someone tell me what's going on, here?
- Who are these people, they're not waxdroids.

190
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,431
- Waxdroids?
- Of course!

191
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,673
This whole place, the entire complex,
is a colossal waxdroid theme park.

192
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,474
See? "Prehistoric World" - that must have been where we materialised.

193
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,234
On either side of it, "Villain World" and "Hero World".

194
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,071
I thought waxdroids were programmed to repeat a
simple sequence of routines over and over again?

195
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,591
They must have broken their
programming and now they're running amok.

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,759
You see, we've been left here all alone
for millions of years... (SOBS)

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,076
We learned to break our programs.

198
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,471
And we've been fighting this
idiotic futile war ever since.

199
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,314
- A war?
- Good versus evil, sugar.

200
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,276
- Where's the rest of your army?
- They've all been killed... (SOBS)

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,394
All our best warriors are gone, man -
John Wayne, Sir Lancelot, Joan of Arc,

202
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,951
Nelson, Wellington... Hell, baby, even Doris Day.

203
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,794
They've all died in battle, man.

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,312
And you're all that's left, just a smattering
of intellectuals, pacifists and celebrities?

205
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,511
We number less than 20.

206
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,191
If only we numbered 21, then at least
we could form an equilateral triangle.

207
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,116
Will you shut up already with the triangles?!
Everything is triangles! You're driving me crazy!

208
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,516
Who do the enemy have?

209
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,559
The cream of evil - Hitler, Napoleon, Messalina,

210
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,234
Caligula, the Boston Strangler, dozens of them.

211
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,037
And we don't even have a leader.
We haven't really got a chance!

212
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,154
My God, Kryten! This is my destiny!

213
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,995
- I was born for this moment!
- I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.

214
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,717
Across that valley lies an army of darkness
such as mankind has never seen.

215
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,511
The only thing between them and total victory
is this pathetic pocket of resistance,

216
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,796
without a leader, without a plan.

217
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,840
And into this bleak arena steps a man -
the man for the moment.

218
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,396
- Oh. who?
- Me! Who do you think, Pat Boone?

219
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,879
Gentlemen, ladies, assemble your troops
for inspection at 1500 hours.

220
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,117
Together with my valiant adjutant, Kryten,

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,719
I'm gonna turn you into the meanest, fittest fighting
machine that ever graced a battlefield.

222
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,797
Come on, Kryten.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,958
(SQUEALS) I don't want to fight! I might get killed!

224
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,756
...and we've been fighting
the Wax War ever since.

225
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,431
- What's the point of this war?
- They want our wax. So they can melt us down,

226
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,672
insert new programs
and turn us into their own kind.

227
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,195
That's why we're becoming
so hopelessly outnumbered.

228
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,519
- On your feet, pigs!
- Hey, buddy, we just...

229
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,030
Silence, scum!

230
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,518
Do you not sink to your knees and bow
in the presence of the Emperor Caligula?

231
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,190
- Who is this guy?
- Caligula's a famous Roman emperor.

232
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,432
He slept with his mother, both his
sisters and ended up eating his son.

233
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,312
Hey, a little advice, bud - we all feel peckish
after making love, but most of us settle for pizza.

234
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,596
You are an impudent fool!

235
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,593
- I don't know who the other one is.
- That's Rasputin.

236
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,440
the most hated, loathed and despised man of his era.

237
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,870
This machine, how does it work?

238
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,597
- I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't be here.
- Very well. that's the way you want to play it?

239
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,593
Rasputin, bring in the bucket of soapy frogs
and remove his trousers!

240
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,474
Hang on, It's got something to do
with travelling across sub-space.

241
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,036
- Demonstrate.
- Well, like I said, I don't really know.

242
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,189
Very well. Rasputin, bring hither
the skin-diving suit with the bottom cut out

243
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,318
and unleash the rampant wildebeest.

244
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,070
Hang on! I'll try my best, I'll try
my best. Just- just give it here.

245
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,796
- Ah! You think I'm insane?
- Shall we take a vote?

246
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,711
Silence, scum!

247
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,235
Shut up!

248
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,030
We'll all hold on to it.

249
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,359
Now!

250
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,790
Come on! Let's get out of here.

251
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,116
Rasputin, I'm very cross indeed! Guards!

252
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,437
(DOGS BARK)

253
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
This way! If we make good time,
we'll be back at HQ by sunset.

254
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,555
What a challenge!
The greatest minds in military history against me.

255
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,714
- Let's pray they're up to it.
- Are you sure your sanity chip is fully screwed in, sir?

256
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,157
Have you any conception of what's
lining up outside for inspection?

257
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,030
I'll soon shake them up. By God, I only
wish the lads from the lo Amateur Wargamers

258
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,795
and the Recreators of the Battle of
Neasden Society could see me now.

259
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,754
They'd choke on their pikestaffs.

260
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:13,079
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

261
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,504
As you were, Sergeant Presley.

262
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,319
Guys are outside, sir. Awaiting
inspection. Thank you very much.

263
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,792
- Well done, Presley.
- Uh-huh-huh.

264
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,713
- After you, sir.
- Kryten, let's see what we've got, eh?

265
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,750
- What's your name, soldier?
- His name's Gandhi, sir. Mahatma Ghandi.

266
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,273
Well, get him out of that damn nappy
and into a uniform. Have you no pride, man?

267
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,435
Don't you want to win this war?
Don't eyeball me, Ghandi.

268
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,399
Get on the floor and give me fifty. Now!

269
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,632
Teresa, sir. Mother Teresa.

270
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,155
Assisi, sir. St Francis of Assisi.

271
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,553
There's only two kinds from Assisi -
steers and queers. Which are you, boy?

272
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,876
Moving hastily on, sir.

273
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,431
- What's he doing here?
- He was posted here from the fiction section.

274
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,318
The Dalai Lama.

275
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,432
Mr Noel Coward, sir.

276
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,513
- Delighted to meet you, dear boy.
- Shut up.

277
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,758
- Monsieur Jean-Paul Sartre, sir.
- Who?

278
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,230
He's a philosopher, sir. He's an existentialist.

279
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,717
Well, Sartre, we don't like
existentialists around here,

280
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,039
and we certainly don't like French philosophers
poncing around in their black polo necks,

281
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,151
filling everyone's heads with their theories about the
bleakness of existence and the absurdity of the cosmos. Clear?

282
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,553
Well, you're quite the worst bunch
of famous historical waxdroids

283
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,270
I've ever had the misfortune
to clap my eyes on!

284
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,798
You're a total bloody shambles,
and if we're gonna win this war,

285
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,430
someone is gonna have to
turn you into soldiers!

286
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,355
And that someone,
ladies and gentlemen, is me!

287
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,916
Over to you, Kryten.

288
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,670
I'm watching you, Gandhi.

289
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,870
# We are tough and we are mean

290
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,395

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,836

296
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,716
# Hey! Hey! #

297
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,470
You're driving them too hard, sir.

298
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,454
It's my job to drive them hard, Kryten.

299
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,674
Three of them have
melted from exhaustion.

300
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,196
Perhaps I have been a bit too tough,
but it's for their own good.

301
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,980
You're killing them for their own good?

302
00:19:57,004 --> 00:20:00,554
Look, when they get out in that battlefield,
don't you think the enemy are going to try and kill them?

303
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,071
They won't need to.
You'll have wiped them all out first.

304
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,430
I know what I'm doing, Kryten.
We attack tomorrow under cover of daylight.

305
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,199
- Daylight, sir?
- It's the last thing they'll be expecting.

306
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,351
a daylight charge over the minefield.

307
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,896
The what-field?!

308
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,953
Obviously, I'll have to coordinate things
from back here. Now this is the plan...

309
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,027
Rimmer!

310
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:26,676
Thank you very much, sir. People say
they know you, sir. Thank you very much.

311
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,229
Listy! Welcome to Command Centre.

312
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,751
Rimmer, what's going on out there?
Isn't that Mahatma Gandhi?

313
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,276
What's he doing practising
hand-to-hand combat with a nun?

314
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,431
That's not a nun, Listy.

315
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,753
That's Lieutenant Colonel Mother Teresa.
She's a soldier now.

316
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,396
- What are you doing, buddy?
- I'm winning this war, that's what I'm doing "buddy".

317
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,838
You won't believe what a ragamuffin bunch
of lefty, wishy-washy liberals they were

318
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,550
before I knocked some good old-fashioned
death-or-glory bloodlust into them.

319
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,072
Rimmer, You've taken a group of holy men and
pacifists and turned them into the Dirty Dozen!

320
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,879
Oh, I can't take all the credit.
I couldn't have done it without Kryten, here.

321
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,711
I'm sorry, sirs. I had no choice. I'm programmed to obey,
no matter how psychotic and deranged the human order.

322
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,550
Rimmer, you're gonna get these guys wiped out.
They're not soldiers!

323
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,184
- He's flipped.
- Yeah!

324
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,597
- With all respect, sir, he's right. I beg you to reconsider.
- They're only waxdroids.

325
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,714
Rimmer, they've broken their programming.
They're capable of independent thought.

326
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,874
That makes them alive, makes them practically people.
I'm not gonna let you do it.

327
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,431
- Pardon me?
- You heard me!

328
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,798
- If you can talk them into it, then I can talk 'em out.
- I see. Sergeant Presley?

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,392
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Place these 'gentlemen' under arrest until further notice.

330
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,519
- If they resist, shoot them.
- Reach for the sky, boys. Let me see them understains.

331
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,711
Come on, Kryten.

332
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,536
He's been acting strangely
ever since we landed here, sir.

333
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,319
I think it might have affected his
mind when you chewed his light-bee.

334
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,433
I'll do more than chew his light-bee
when we get out of here.

335
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,517
(RIMMER) Kryteeeen!

336
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,996
Thank you very much.
You've been wonderful prisoners, you really have.

337
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,671
Well, I don't know about the enemy,
but you certainly scare the hell out of me!

338
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,150
Let's get this show on the road.

339
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,836
Company... advance!

340
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,476
- (WHOOPING AND GUNFIRE)
- Kryten.

341
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,275
You know what you have to do.

342
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,479
- Let's go, Holly.
- OK, matey.

343
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,198
(CHANTS)

344
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,752
(SQUEAKS)

345
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,598
(SHRIEKS)

346
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,311
Good shot!

347
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,190
Destroy them! Shoot them!

348
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,474
Iron Duke? Iron Duke? This is, er, Pawn Sacrifice.

349
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,439
- Come in, please.
- (RIMMER) Kryten, how's it going?

350
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,353
I'm in the Third Reich building.
Minimal resistance.

351
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,195
Just as you planned,
the decoy charge has drawn their fire.

352
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,035
OK. Now find the boiler room
and hit the thermostat.

353
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,192
They'll melt once it hits 100 degrees.

354
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,476
I'm on my way, sir.

355
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,877
Victory, gentlemen! The fascists have fallen.

356
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,391
- May I untie them now, sir?
- Rejoice. We conquer!

357
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,155
Victory on Waxworld! It's VW Day!

358
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,031
- So you took the HQ, wiped them all out?
- To a droid.

359
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,158
- It's true. All melted.
- What about Arnie's army?

360
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,315
- Yeah, how many of them made it back?
- There are always casualties in war, gentlemen.

361
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,519
Otherwise, it wouldn't be war, just be a rather
nasty argument with lots of pushing and shoving.

362
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,189
- How many survived?
- Well, we haven't had time to make a full official estimate,

363
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,718
but at a rough guess - and obviously this is
subject to alteration pending information updates

364
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,917
round about none of them.

365
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,316
So, you wiped out the entire
population of this planet?

366
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,911
You make it sound so negative, Lister. Don't you see?

367
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,397
The deranged menace that once
threatened this world is vanquished.

368
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,479
No, it isn't, pal. You're still here.

369
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,712
I brought about peace.
Peace, freedom and democracy.

370
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,957
Yeah, Rimmer. Right. Absolutely.

371
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,931
Now all the corpses that litter
that battlefield can just lie there,

372
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,725
safe in the knowledge that they
snuffed it under a flag of peace,

373
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:53,353
and can now happily decompose in
a land of freedom... you smeghead.

374
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,870
There really is no pleasing some people, is there?

375
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,549
Well, at least we got the Matter Paddle back.

376
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,758
Well, there's nothing to stay here for.
Let's get back.

377
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,032
Shouldn't we go into the battlefield and bask in the glow of victory?

378
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,436
Holly, give me his light-bee.

379
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,673
- See you, Rimmer.
- Sir! What are you thinking of?

380
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,193
It's OK. He'll come out in a couple a days...

381
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,759
..and he'll have been through
what he put us through.

382
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,957
Does any one fancy a vindaloo?

383
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,638
(ELVIS SINGS) # It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

384
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,952
 # I'm all alone, more or less

385
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,715
# Let me fly far away from here

386
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,156
# Fun, fun, fun

387
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,995
# In the sun, sun, sun

388
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,710
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

389
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,713
# Drinking fresh mango juice

390
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,510
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

391
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,956
# Fun, fun, fun

392
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,670
# In the sun, sun, sun

393
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,798
# I said fun, fun, fun

394
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,669
# In the sun, sun, sun #

395
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,150
Huh! Great to be back!

396
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,079
Huh!

397
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,151
Thank you very much.
