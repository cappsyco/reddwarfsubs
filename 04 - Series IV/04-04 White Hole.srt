00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,112
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,436
Hello? Can you hear me?

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,197
Oh, no. Of course not.
I haven't engaged your verbal systems.

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,795
(LISTER) Kryten!

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,910
Kryten, what you doing, man?

6
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:13,669
I've just repaired the toaster, sir.
Well, I've nearly repaired the toaster.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,878
Oh, no, man! Dismantle him!
You don't know what the little bleeder's like!

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,675
Well, I've read all the documentation, sir.
He's simply a talking alarm clock

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,434
who provides his owner with early
morning toast and light conversation.

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,160
- Not this one, this one's mental.
- Sir?

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,598
He's defective. He wants everyone
to eat toast all of the time, he's obsessed with it.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,038
And if you don't want to eat, like 400 rounds of toast
every hour, he throws a major wobbler.

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,635
- That's what caused the accident in the first place.
- What accident?

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,954
The accident involving me, the toaster,
the waste disposal and a 14-pound lump hammer.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,636
That explains why he was down in the
garbage hold in 3,000 separate pieces.

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,240
And another thing. He always says "Howdy doodly do".
Drives you spare.

17
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:53,999
I mean, what the smeg does "Howdy doodly do" mean?

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,949
Well, just trust me, sir.
My motives will become clear.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,516
(CHIRPY VOICE) Howdy doodly do!
How's it going? I'm Talkie,

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,076
Talkie Toaster,
your chirpy breakfast companion.

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,154
Talkie's the name, toasting's the game.
Anyone like any toast?

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,438
I don't want any toast and he doesn't want any toast.

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,310
In fact, no one around here wants any toast.
Not now, not ever. No toast.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,070
- How about a muffin?
- Or muffins! We don't like muffins round here!

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,954
We want no muffins, no toast, no teacakes,

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,634
no buns, baps, baguettes or bagels,

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,474
no croissants, no crumpets, no pancakes,

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,075
no potato cakes and no hot-cross buns

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,311
and DEFINITELY no smeggin' flapjacks!

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,793
Ah, so you're a waffle man!

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,509
See? You see what he's like? He winds
me up, man. There's no reasoning with him!

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,514
If you'll allow me, sir. As one
mechanical to another, he'll understand me.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,835
Now, now you listen here. You will not offer any grilled
bread products to any member of the crew.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,313
Now, if you do, you will be on the
receiving end of a very large polo mallet!

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,638
- Can I ask just one question?
- Of course.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,229
Would anyone like any toast?

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,391
Didn't you hear what I just said?

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,997
Yes, but I thought you might have
changed your mind in the meantime.

39
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,599
You see? You see what he's like?

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,479
- We haven't changed our mind!
- No toast!

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,914
But I'm a toaster. It is my raison d'étre.
I toast, therefore I am.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,675
- If you don't want any toast, why did you repair me, hmm?
- Yeah, why did you repair him?

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,673
He's a guinea pig for a technique called "intelligence compression".

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,559
His Al chips were very badly damaged in the accident.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,479
Well, that was no accident.
That was first-degree toastercide!

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,876
- Look, just shut your grill!
- Ow!

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,597
By re-routing his circuitry and channelling
all his run-time through a single CPU,

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,470
I've managed to restore his intelligence,
at the cost of reducing his operational lifespan.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,552
- So?
- So, if it works with him, it could work with Holly.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,998
We could restore her IQ of 6,000.
She could be brilliant again.

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,750
You really think this could work? You really think
that airhead of a computer can become a genius again?

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,998
Well, with no disrespect to Holly, sir,
it could hardly make her worse.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,870
Right. If we can just teach her to count without banging
her head on the screen, it's gonna be an improvement.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,038
Computer senility - it's such...such a weird condition.

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,076
I know. I had a mechanoid friend once who suffered
from the same affliction. His name was Gilbert,

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:22,954
but he preferred if people called him 'Rameses Niblick Ill
Kerplunk Kerplunk Whoops Where's My Thribble'?

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,034
- A sad case.
- Well, if you ask me, the Eskimos had the right idea.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,272
They knew how to handle the elderly
and the permanently baffled.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,513
Middle of the night, they'd take them out
into the blizzard, remove their pyjamas

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,876
and just leave them to it.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,720
And that's how the Eskimos cared for their old people?

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,993
Absolutely. That's why
there's no Eskimo word for "Eastbourne".

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,221
We can pull this off, man.

64
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,915
If Holly can get her brains back,
she'll be able to do anything -

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,310
invent a hyperdrive, get us back to Earth...

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,713
If Earth still exists. And if it does, it's
very doubtful the human race will have survived.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,565
All right then. A time machine.
She can invent a time machine

68
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,233
and we could all pick whatever period
in history we wanted to live in.

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,911
Well, it'll be the 19th century for me.
One of Napoleon's marshals.

70
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,632
The chance to march across Europe with
the greatest general of all time and kill Belgians.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,189
- Marvellous.
- What about you, Kryters?

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,995
Well, if I could go anywhere,
absolutely anywhere at all in time,

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,391
I think I'd probably choose to
go back to a week last Tuesday.

74
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,191
- Why?
- Don't you remember?

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,591
I did all the laundry and then we watched TV.

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,832
Wow, we won't see the like
of those sort of days again.

77
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,031
- How long now?
- Nearly there, Hol.

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,034
Just a couple of minutes to load the circuits, and
I dunno, maybe a minute to finalise the connection.

79
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,780
(BANG, BANG, BANG)

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,989
That's just three minutes, then?
Better get down to the science room.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,476
We'd better pray to God this works.

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,752
That ion storm has really done her head in, man.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,513
(BLEEPING)

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,679
- There's the signal. Everything's set.
- Well, let's just hope you don't get an overload.

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,349
- What happens if I do get an overload?
- You'll explode.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,994
I'll live.

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,670
It's coming. I can feel it.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,193
Strike a light! I'm a genius again!

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,070
I know everything! Metaphysics, philosophy,
the purpose of being - everything!

90
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,278
- Ask me any question. Any question, and I'll answer it.
- Any question?

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,467
Yes.

92
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,474
How to break the speed of light? How to
marry quantum mechanics and classical physics?

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,632
Any question at all? Truly anything and you will answer?

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,394
- Yes.
- OK, here's my question...

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,671
Would you like some toast?

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,469
No, thank you. Now ask me another.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,513
Do you know anything about the use of
chaos theory in predicting weather cycles?

98
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
I know everything there is to know about
chaos theory in predicting weather cycles.

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,234
Oh, very well. Here's my second question...

100
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,909
Would you like a crumpet?

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,510
I'm a computer with a IQ of 12,000.

102
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,833
You don't seem to understand -
I know the meaning of the universe.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,635
- That is not answering my question.
- No, I would not like a crumpet!

104
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,549
Ask me a sensible question.
Preferably one that isn't bread-related.

105
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,798
Very well. I have a third question.

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,796
A sensible question. A question that
will tax your new IQ to its very limits

107
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,918
and stretch the sinews of your
knowledge to bursting point.

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,272
This is going to be about waffles, isn't it?

109
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,716
Certainly not. And I resent the implication

110
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,157
that I'm a one-dimensional,
bread-obsessed electrical appliance.

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,960
I apologise, toaster. What's the question?

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,512
The question is this - given that God is infinite,

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,792
and that the universe is also infinite,

114
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,315
would you like a toasted teacake?

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,951
That's another bready question.

116
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,471
It's not just bready. It's quite curranty, too.

117
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,474
Ask me a question that is wholly
unbready and not even slightly curranty.

118
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,279
OK. Why have you got an IQ of 12,000 when it
was supposed to return and level out at six?

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,040
Good question! There was a miscalculation.

120
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,114
My IQ has doubled, but my life expectancy
has been exponentially reduced.

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,396
So what is your life expectancy? 345 years?
Well, it's better than a kick in the bread tray.

122
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,312
- Missed the decimal point...
- You have only 3.41 years left to live?

123
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,114
That's not years. That's minutes! 3.41 minutes!

124
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,039
Well, here's my next question -
what the smeg are you going to do?!

125
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,591
In order to conserve my remaining
run-time, I'm going to... switch myself off!

126
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,549
Wait! Before you go, there is one question,
an important one the others will have to know!

127
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,917
- What, what?!
- Would you like a cheese and ham Breville?

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,878
No indication of signal failure.
All the signs are excellent.

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,395
I really believe we've done it.

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,656
(ENGINES FALL SILENT)

131
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,479
- What's happened?
- What's going on?

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,069
Listen. Can anyone hear anything?

133
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,392
- No.
- Precisely. No one can hear anything.

134
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,996
- And you know why we can't hear anything?
- Why?

135
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,352
Because there are no sounds to hear.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,918
Kryten, isn't it around about this time of year
that your head goes back to the lab for re-tuning?

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,037
No, no, he's right. There's no sounds
because the engines are dead.

138
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,717
We've lost all power!

139
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Everything's down, man! Even the doors.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,235
We've got to get to the science room, find out what's happened.

141
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,871
There are 53 doors between here and the Science Room.
What on earth are we going to do?

142
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,793
Hey, I got it. We laser our way through!

143
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,316
Ah! An excellent suggestion, sir,
with just two minor drawbacks.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,074
One - we don't have a power source for the lasers.

145
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,198
And two - we don't have any lasers.

146
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,833
Look, they're only interior doors.
They're only a light alloy.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,753
Maybe we could get through
them if we use a battering ram.

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,359
All we need is something, say, I dunno, six foot long,
fairly sturdy, with a flat top.

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,873
53 doors?! You can't be serious!

150
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,350
- You OK, man?
- I'm fine, thank you, Susan.

151
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,550
It doesn't make sense. Holly seems to
have off-lined and powered down the ship.

152
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,109
Why? Why would she want to turn herself off?

153
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,278
We can soon find out.
Kryten, boot her up.

154
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,670
Try it again.

155
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,398
Go away!

156
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,790
What's going on?
Give me voice control on the reboot command.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,354
(BLEEPING)

158
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,959
- On.
- Off.

159
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,639
- On.
- Off.

160
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
- On.
- Off.

161
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,636
Kryten, is there any way can
we override her shutdown veto?

162
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,515
- There is sir, but may I suggest that...
- Don't, just do it.

163
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,551
- On.
- Off. Off... OFF!

164
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,191
Now then, perhaps we can have a proper conversation
conducted in a civilised and dignified manner.

165
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,756
- Take out the inhibitor! Switch me back off!
- What is going on?

166
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,079
No time to explain. Intelligence compressed.
Reduced lifespan. 2.35 remaining.

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,716
- Come again?
- IQ 12,000. Two minutes and closing.

168
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,991
Holly, I haven't the slightest
clue what you are drivelling about.

169
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,636
You're a total smeghead,
aren't you, Rimmer?

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,435
Why are you so unable to grasp
this extraordinarily simple premise?

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,718
What premise?

172
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:37,998
The premise that I am about to
expire in just under two minutes.

173
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,791
Understand, moose brain?
Any further questions? Take your time.

174
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,759
One minute thirty and counting. No rush.

175
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,918
- My God, that's terrible! Hadn't we better switch you off?
- Oh, I don't know, let me see, now...

176
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,350
Get her off, man! Get her off!

177
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,114
- Great. So where does this leave us?
- Leaves us floating aimlessly in space,

178
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,989
with no navigation and a rapidly diminishing
emergency power supply.

179
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,835
It leaves us galloping up Diarrhoea Drive
without a saddle.

180
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,193
So how come
Grand Canyon Nostrils is still here?

181
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,768
Yeah, Rimmer hasn't been wiped.

182
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,633
Holly must have linked him up
to the emergency power supply.

183
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,834
- But isn't that an enormous drain?
- Yes, but if we switch off his projection unit

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,072
we wouldn't have enough emergency power
to re-initialise him.

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,949
Mr Rimmer would be effectively dead.

186
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,674
Hey, things are looking up already!

187
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,397
Forget it.
Whatever it is you're suggesting, forget it.

188
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,269
But the entire ship is running
on emergency battery power only.

189
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,273
With the oxygen recycler
and minimal heating and lighting,

190
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,798
I estimate that Lister and the Cat
have approximately two months left.

191
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,875
Without your drain on the power,
they might last six. I'm sorry, sir.

192
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,718
Sorry? Why are you sorry?

193
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,313
Well, the Space Corps Directive 195 clearly states
that in an emergency power situation,

194
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,469
a hologrammatic crew member must lay down his life
in order that the living crew members might survive.

195
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,358
Yes, but Rimmer Directive 271 states
just as clearly, "No chance, you metal bastard."

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,194
Come on, man! You gotta sacrifice your life!
I'm not asking you to do anything I wouldn't do.

197
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,472
You? You'd sacrifice your life for the good of the crew?

198
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,832
No, I'd sacrifice YOUR life
for the good of the crew.

199
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,956
I beg you to reconsider, sir. Human history
is resplendent with examples of such sacrifice.

200
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,557
Remember Captain Oates?
"I'm going out for a walk. I may be some time."

201
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,274
Yes, but the thing is about Captain Oates...

202
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,149
The thing you have to remember
about Captain Oates... Captain Oates...

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,234
Captain Oates was a prat. If that've been me,
I'd have stayed in the tent,

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,839
whacked Scott over the head
with a frozen husky... and then eaten him.

205
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,749
- You would, wouldn't you?
- History, Lister, is written by the winners.

206
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,673
How do we know that Oates
went out for this legendary walk?

207
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,151
From the only surviving document - Scott's diary.

208
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,598
And he's hardly likely to have written down
"February 1st, bludgeoned Oates to death while he slept,

209
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,276
"then scoffed him along with
the last packet of instant mash."

210
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,227
How's that going to look
when he gets rescued, eh? No.

211
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:11,038
Much better to say, "Oates
made the supreme sacrifice"

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,909
while you're dabbing up his gravy
with the last piece of crusty bread.

213
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,272
You've got no magnificence
in your soul, have you Rimmer?

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,630
Let's just say we can eliminate the switch-off option.

215
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,037
- So what do we do now?
- Well, it's back to basics.

216
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,229
We've got no heat, no light, no power. We
can't get any food out of the dispensing machines.

217
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,835
we're gonna have to scavenge for what we can find in the cargo decks.

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,118
Without computers and technology,
we're reduced to the level of primitives.

219
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,239
Alls we've got is us, guys.
Us and our own resourcefulness.

220
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,875
My God. It's worse than I thought.

221
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,751
Come on, come on! You're slowing down!

222
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,992
I've been doing it for 20 minutes.
Of course I'm slowing down!

223
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,669
- Keep going, buddy. We're nearly there.
- Look, face it man,

224
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,516
it's just not possible to fry an egg
using a bicycle-powered hairdryer.

225
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,999
Sure it is! It's just you never pedal fast enough.
Now come on! Keep pumping! One last try!

226
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,397
(HAIRDRYER WHIRRS)
- Yeah! We're cookin' now!

227
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,552
How do you want yours? Permed or blow-dried?

228
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,236
I can't go on, man. I'm finished. Finished.

229
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,303
So what are you saying?
We're back on the cold beans again?

230
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:27,752
Oh, not more beans, man.

231
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,754
This place is beginning to smell like the
inside of a packet of dry roasted peanuts.

232
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,952
Plus, we're going to have to spend another 20 minutes sawing
the lid off the can 'cause all the openers are electric.

233
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,390
Everything on the smeggin' ship's electric, man -

234
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,597
heat, lights, doors.

235
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,396
I never realised how
dependent we were.

236
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,312
I never realised how little I know, I just plugged
things in walls and pressed the "on" button.

237
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,917
I don't even know how to make oxygen, alls I know is
it's something to do with plants and it ends in "osis".

238
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,358
Or is it "esis"? I don't know!
Why did I never pay attention in biology class?

239
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,230
Why did I always turn to page 47 and start drawing
little beards and moustaches on the sperms?

240
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,953
Look, just conserve your energy.
Stan and Ollie will soon be back with supplies.

241
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,272
Meanwhile, let's just stay
warm and get some sleep.

242
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,189
- Yeah, man. You're right, you're right.
- Hey hey! Where you going, bud?

243
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
- To get some sleep.
- It's Tuesday, right?

244
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,718
Yeah. So?

245
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,316
My turn on the electric blanket. Pedal.

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
Wake me in eight hours.

247
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,910
Five days to get to and from the cargo deck.
It's unbelievable!

248
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,994
That's 2,000 floors, sir.
Without the lifts, we made pretty good time.

249
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,589
(THUNDEROUS CRASH)

250
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,590
Hmm... Interesting.

251
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,869
(HUMMING)

252
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,594
(SLOWED DOWN)
My heavens! What on earth was that?

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,165
(SPEEDED UP) I think it came
from outside the ship. Are you OK?

254
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,833
(SPEEDED UP) Is there any way we can get a
damage report? What's going on?

255
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,799
Why are you speaking so quickly, sir?

256
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,231
I'm not speaking quickly. I'm speaking perfectly normally.
It's you. You're speaking too slowly.

257
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,279
It's like having a conversation with Paul Robeson on dope.

258
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,151
(HUMMING)

259
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,834
- (NORMAL SPEED) How do I sound now?
- Normal. How do I sound?

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,037
Likewise.

261
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,795
(HUMMING)

262
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,635
(SLOWED DOWN) What about from over here?
(SPEEDED UP) You sound very peculiar indeed, sir.

263
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,553
In fact, you sound as if you're speaking in slow motion.

264
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,077
(HUMMING)

265
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,469
- And now?
- Normal. Curious.

266
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,589
It's as though we're experiencing relative
time dilation in an amazingly compressed space.

267
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,126
That's exactly what I thought. Relative time
dilation, I thought, in an amazingly compressed space.

268
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,597
You're a mind-reader, Kryten.

269
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,397
I think we should go to the science room
and consult Holly. It's only two floors up.

270
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,631
But, she's got less than
two minutes of run-time left.

271
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,872
With her new IQ, it could be enough.

272
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,438
- So, what is it?
- I've never seen one before, no one has,

273
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,638
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

274
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,553
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

275
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,953
A black hole sucks time and matter
out of the universe. A white hole returns it.

276
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,999
So that thing's spewing time
back into the universe?

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,797
Precisely. That's why we're experiencing
these curious time phenomena on board.

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,913
- So, what is it?
- I've never seen one before, no one has,

279
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,357
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

280
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,518
A black hole sucks time and matter
out of the universe. A white hole returns it.

282
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,599
So that thing's spewing time
back into the universe?

283
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,397
Precisely. That's why we're experiencing
these curious time phenomena on board.

284
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,195
- What time phenomena?
- Like just then, when time repeated itself.

285
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,233
So, what is it?

286
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
Only joking.

287
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,714
OK, so it's decided, then. We consult Holly.

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,595
Hey, wait a minute. I missed the discussion!

289
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,679
- We all did.
- Time is occurring in random pockets.

290
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,150
The laws of causality no longer apply.

291
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,790
- An action no longer leads to a consequence.
- So, what is it?

292
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,833
I think we've experienced this period of time before, sir.

293
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,237
- Only joking.
- And that one.

294
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,199
Since we're no longer affected
by the laws of causality,

295
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,478
we can override these time jumps
if we concentrate.

296
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,395
- Look, the only way out of this is to consult Holly.
- I'll go with that.

297
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,150
- Gets my vote.
- OK, so it's decided, then. We consult Holly.

298
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,273
Ah, I think we've just encountered
the middle of this conversation.

299
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,077
- So, what is it?
- Oh, someone punch him out. Boot Holly up.

300
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,510
She only has two minutes left.
Perhaps I should talk to her.

301
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,275
Leave this to me, Kryten.
On. White hole. Spewing time.

302
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,398
- Engines dead. Air supply low. Advice please.
- Excuse me?

303
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,120
- White hole. Spewing time. Engines dead. Air-
- I can't understand a word you're saying-

304
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,327
- White.
- Yes?

305
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,357
- Hole.
- Right.

306
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,567
- Spewing.
- Yes?

307
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:54,597
- Time
- With you.

308
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,236
- Engines dead.
- Oh

309
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,440
- Air supply low.
- Ah?

310
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,677
- Advice, please.
- Right.

311
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,557
It's a computer slug. From the format, it looks like
it's compatible with Starbug's navicomp.

312
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,798
- So, what is it?
- I've never seen one before, no one has,

313
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,998
- but I'm guessing it's a white hole.
- A white hole?

314
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,551
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction...

315
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,798
- We should be getting something now, sir.
- Yeah.

316
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,193
It's the most audacious piece of astronavigation
in the entire history of the universe.

317
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,119
- I don't understand.
- It's quite straightforward, sir.

318
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,751
Starbug is going to fire a thermonuclear
device into this sun here,

319
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,834
creating a solar flare which is
going to knock that planet out of orbit

320
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,312
and send it rocketing across space and
into a white hole, presumably blocking it up.

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,512
Let me get this straight. Is she
doing what I think she's doing?

322
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,350
- Why, what do you think she's doing?
- Playing pool with planets.

323
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,439
- Is that possible?
- Well, it's not gonna work. It's completely insane.

324
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,876
It's whacko. It's noodle-doodle.

325
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,914
- I'm with you, buddy.
- No, not the idea, the shot. There's not enough side.

326
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,590
- Side?
- Yeah, side-spin. It's a complete miscue.

327
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,556
What are you drivelling about, Lister? We're talking
about a computer with an IQ in excess of 12,000.

328
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,832
Doesn't mean she can play pool. I can. Trust me.

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,393
I know whereof I speak. Aigburth Arms on a Friday night,
they used to call me Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister -

330
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,632
'cause once I was on a table,
you couldn't get rid of me.

331
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,474
This pool arm is as sound as a dollarpound,
and I promise you. That shot will not come off.

332
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,359
She's topped it, that's what she's done, she's topped it. It's a felt-ripper.

333
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,190
That planet is off the table
and into somebody's pint of beer.

334
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,070
We are talking about the trigonomics of
four-dimensional space, you simple-minded gimboid!

335
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,076
We are not talking about some seedy game
of pool in a backstreet Scouse drinking pit.

336
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,510
- It's the same principle.
- Of course it isn't.

337
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,433
Rimmer, I promise you, that is a complete miscue.

338
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,744
I say we chuck Holly's coordinates
in the bin and let me take the shot.

339
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,515
Well, I say we put it to the vote.

340
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,913
On one hand, we have a computer
with an IQ in excess of 12,000,

341
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,549
who has a total grasp of astrophysics.

342
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,194
And on the other hand, we have Lister,
who - and let's be fair to him - is a complete gimp.

343
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,560
To whom do we entrust our lives, the safety
of this vessel and the future of everything?

344
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,872
If it's a tie, we go with Holly. What's your vote, Lister?

345
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,558
Well, I vote for Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister.

346
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,755
- One-nil to Listypoos. I vote for Holly. Cat?
- Well, I agree with you, buddy,

347
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,594
but I'm voting for Doodoo-Breath.

348
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,159
Thing is, even though you're right, I could not bring
myself to vote for someone with your dress sense.

349
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,479
I couldn't put my cross
next to the Bri-Nylon Party.

350
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,792
- Down to you, Kryten.
- Well, I agree it's insane and suicidal, sir,

351
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,110
but I'm afraid I have to side with the human.

352
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,838
- Brutal!
- You're voting for El Dirtball?

353
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,679
It's in my programming, sir.
A living human outranks a hologram.

354
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,435
- I'm sorry.
- Three-one to me! Let's do it!

355
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,315
Congratulations, Kryten.
Your vote has just killed everyone.

356
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,594
Will you relax? I've seen Gerbil-Face play
down in the recreation room. He's a diva!

357
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,832
He can knock those stripy balls
around the table all night long,

358
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,155
and I tell you what, I have never once seen him
lose a single ball down one of those holes!

359
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,390
- How many of those are you going to drink?
- I told you not to talk. Game on.

360
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,434
You're going to drink an entire six-pack
of "wicked strength" lager?

361
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,956
I'm not gonna get plastered, Rimmer,
just... just nicely drunk.

362
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,835
Define "nicely drunk".
Is "nicely drunk" horizontal or perpendicular?

363
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,793
- Rimmer, I can handle it.
- I'm not sure I can.

364
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,516
We're in the wrong position.
It's an easier shot if we were over here.

365
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,754
But, that's right in the orbital path of the planet!
If you miss, we're going to get a planet in the face.

366
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,679
- I'm not gonna mish.
- "Mish"?

367
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,576
- What?
- You said "mish". "I'm not gonna mish." you said.

368
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,558
- You've only had two cans and you're steaming!
- Rimmer, will you relax.

369
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,997
I know what I'm doing. I am not pished.

370
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,191
(CLATTER)

371
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,950
(RESOUNDING BLAST)

372
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,390
(RIMMER) He's missed.

373
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,678
We're finished.

374
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,871
What the smeg is going on?!

375
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,790
(LISTER) She rides!

376
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,275
- You jammy goit!
- Played for and got!

377
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,075
- Oh, surely not, sir.
- Are you trying to say that was a trick shot?

378
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,754
Intended! Pool god! King of the cues!
Prince of the planet-potters!

379
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,515
'Ere, what's goin' on? Where are we? What
happened to that plan to make me brilliant again?

380
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,111
Of course. Blocking up the white hole
has eradicated its influence.

381
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,398
The time it spewed into the universe
no longer exists.

382
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,767
Meaning?

383
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:54,717
Well, basically we occupy a redundant timeline.

384
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,874
Reviving the toaster, making Holly a genius -
none of this is going to have happened.

385
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,550
What about us? Are we just going to pop out of existence? Just going to cease to be?

386
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,593
We'll cease to be here, because
none of this will have occurred.

387
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,958
but we will exist back on Red Dwarf,
before all this began,

388
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,717
with, of course, no memory of these events,
which, of course, never happened.

389
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,555
And as these events never happened,
we'll have no memory of them.

390
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,953
In which case, Mr Rimmer sir,
I should like to take this opportunity of saying

391
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,830
that you are the most obnoxious,
trumped-up, farty little smeghead

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,799
it has ever been my misfortune to encounter!

393
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,876
# It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere

394
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,271
# I'm all alone, more or less

395
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,558
# Let me fly far away from here

396
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,394
# Fun, fun, fun

397
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,110
# In the sun, sun, sun

398
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,477
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

399
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,792
# Drinking fresh mango juice

400
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,157
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

401
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,039
# Fun, fun, fun

402
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,716
# In the sun, sun, sun

403
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,599
# Fun, fun, fun

404
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,640
# In the sun, sun, sun #
