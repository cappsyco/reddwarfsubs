Arnold?

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,470
- Arnold!
- I'm here, Mother!

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,469
You know your father and I have been terribly
worried about your progress at school.

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,647
Yes, Mother.

6
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,594
You just haven't been getting
the marks we think you're capable of.

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,120
No, Mother.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,675
Well, a few days ago I went to see the headmaster.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,246
He said it might be in your best interest
if you were to be kept down a year,

10
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,552
if you were to stay in
Junior D for another year.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,394
- Oh.
- Is that all you've got to say?

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,714
Well, it is quite difficult to talk
when you're tied upside down to a tree.

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,633
- Have you been playing with Howard and Frank?
- Yes.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,076
Well, what on earth were you playing?

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,314
Well, I said it was a such a shame we haven't
got a swing. Then they said they could make one.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,678
I didn't realise
they was going to make one out of me.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,557
Well, that's nice, darling. Anyway,
your father had a word with the headmaster,

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,794
and we explained how much we wanted you to be a test
pilot in the Space Corps like your brother John,

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,514
and how this could damage your chances.

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,759
We got this this morning.
You realise how important this is?

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,800
This decision could completely
alter the whole course of your life.

Whoa! Welcome home, Ace!

24
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,472
- Bless you, Spanners, old friend. It's good to be home.
- Well, how'd she behave?

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,559
The lightship? Like a frolicking filly in a harvest-time pasture.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,839
How you and your boys down in engineering got that crate
to break the light barrier, I'll never know.

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,273
Well, some people might say it's the devilishly
brave and handsome guy in the cockpit that did it.

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,678
Tsh-pshaw! Nonsense.
Any old twit can hug the event horizon of a black hole,

and blast out of an imploding nebula.

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,364
It's you and your guys with the magic
wrenches down in engineering, Spanners.

32
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,719
You're the ones who
break the records.

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,434
You'll be going to this party thing they're throwing for you tonight, I suppose?

me to the land of Nod, Spanners.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,351
I'll be down in the mess with the
salt-of-the-earth engineering boys, as per usual.

- See you later, Ace.

He's pulled through, be on
his feet in no time thanks to you.

Sitting by his bedside
day after day, night after night,

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
holding his hand, reading him stories...

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,876
You know me, Chaplain. Any old excuse
to get out of dinner with the Admiral.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,153
Listen, 1900, we're having a bit of a bash down in the mess.
It would mean a lot to me if you were there.

- 1900.

If only it were true. What are you doing lunchtime?

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,117
- Not sure. why?
- Because, if you're interested,

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,910
I'll be in my quarters, covered in maple syrup.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,356
I'm sorry, Mellie, I don't fraternise with the staff.

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,676
- I resign.
- I'll be there at 1300.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,278
- You're back.
- 'Fraid so.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,070
Had the feeling you might be.
Rubber shares went up this morning.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,952
- You wanted to see me, Bongo?
- Ever heard of a thing called the 'dimension theory of reality'?

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,796
Doesn't that run along the lines that there is an infinite
number of parallel universes where every possibility exists?

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,278
It's along those lines, yeah. The basic tenet
states that for every decision that's made,

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,353
the alternative decision
is played out in another reality.

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,796
So?

62
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,551
So, the lab boys have come up with a
drive that can break the speed of reality.

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,151
Those boffins have hammered together
a crate that can cross dimensions?

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,630
- When do I launch?
- It's a one-way ticket, Ace

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,758
- There's no coming back.
- I'm free at 1500.

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,436
You do realise that this is a prototype.
There's no way of knowing if it'll even get there.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,797
- Where is 'there', exactly?
- You'll be transported to an alternative reality,

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,554
a reality where there's another Arnold Rimmer.

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,317
Some decision was made at some point in your life
where he went one way and you went the other.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,269
- He might find he's quite different to you.
- Sounds like quite a caper.

71
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,750
You'll do it?

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,630
I'm a test pilot in the Space Corps, Bongo.
It's my job to do it.

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,798
I know this probably won't interest you, but er, I'd hate myself
for the rest of my life if I didn't at least suggest it...

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,799
- Suggest what?
- If you're interested,

75
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,557

covered in taramasalata.

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
It isn't. It's been happily married for 35 years.
It's just a chap like you can turn a guy's head.

78
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,675
I'm sorry, Bongo. Lunch is... on Mellie.

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,077
Would it make any difference
if it was... hoummos?

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,430
I'm sorry, Bongo. I'm strictly butter side up.

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,989
Understood.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,310
What a guy!

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,713
- God speed and bless you, son!
- All systems check.

- You're going fishing without me.
- Oh come off it, man. Don't be ridiculous!

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,152
Hey, what are you doing with the lights on?
Come on, let's get out of here before...

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,352
- I don't believe it. All three of you.
- What's he talking about?

99
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,957
I dunno. For some reason, he's got this crazy whacked-out
idea that we're all going on a fishing holiday.

We didn't WANT to go without you.
We just thought it wasn't your scene.

107
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,874
I mean, fishing. Well, it's boring, isn't it?

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,551
I love fishing! The glow of the dawn,
the line arcing into the water...

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,639
That's it, that's exactly the reason
we didn't invite you. There's no fish.

110
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,357
That, at least, is true, sir. We sent down a search
probe and there's no marine life on the entire planet.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,157
We're just gonna sit out on Starbug, dangle the rods
over the side and have a few cans, you know. Chill out.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,069
I don't believe anybody who'd want to go on a
fishing holiday where they know there's no fish.

113
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,956
We used to do it all the time back home.
We used to go down the canal. Never any fish in that.

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,158
We used to go condom fishing.

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,790
I swear, one time I caught
this two-pound black ribbed nobbler!

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,991
It was about that big!

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,110
Why didn't you just say, "Dear Rimmer, we're going
on a fishing holiday and don't want you to come"?

118
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,432
- See? That's what I said we should say!
- Shh!

119
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,758
I don't know what it is about me.
All my life it's been the same old story.

120
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,669
It's not easy you know? To come in every night,
look in that mirror and see a guy nobody likes.

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,874
How do you think we feel?
We gotta look at it all day!

122

Look, we just thought you wouldn't want to come.

123
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,073
I try to be liked. God knows I try.

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,593
I regale you with amusing stories of when I was
treasurer of the Hammond Organ Owners' Society.

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,797
You never laugh.

126
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,833
I offer to talk you through my photo collection
of 20th-century telegraph poles.

127
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,510
You've always got some excuse.
None of you like Morris dancing.

128
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,950
Would that break your hearts, every once in a while,

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,069
the four of us getting our knees in the air,
the jingle of bells, the clonk of wood on wood?

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
You know, every time I
suggest it, you all pretend to be ill.

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,151
You've got it wrong, man.
We just thought you wouldn't want to come.

132
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,153
Now we know you do, great, you can come.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,269
The way you're going about it. It's like there's some major
conspiracy we've been planning it for days. We haven't.

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,033
- Really?
- Really.

135
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,190
All right, then. I'll come. I'll just get dressed, Holly?

136
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,755
Oh, who woke him up?

137
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,710
- (RIMMER) Steady now, Kryten.
- (KRYTEN) Yes, sir.

138
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,197
Best to get there in one piece than to rush it and cause an accident, eh?

139
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,786
- I have passed my test, sir. I am a fully qualified pilot.
- Mind that star!

140
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,390
That star is over two light years away, sir.
We're nowhere near it.

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,754
There's no percentage in being a boy racer, Kryten.
OK, you passed your test but... Mind that planet!

142
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,997
- Which planet?
- That planet!

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,118
That's the planet we're heading to, sir.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,038
Excellent. Excellent. Plot an orbital course.
We'll be there in no time.

145
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,029
- Yes, sir. I have done, sir.
- Yes, and get the second stage under way.

146
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,246
I already have done, sir.

147
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,313
But you haven't correlated the data
with the main computer banks, have you?

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,360
- Yes, sir. I have, sir.
- You know... you know your trouble, Kryten?

149
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,359
- What, sir?
- You're a git.

150
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,311
Stupid...
Three weeks stuck with Captain Yawn.

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,434
Look, it wasn't my fault. I could have sweet-talked our
way out of it if you hadn't have blown the whole gaff.

152
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,870
Me? What did I do? You're the one who woke him up!

153
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,995
I could've sweet-talked my way out of it, but, oh no,
but you had to come blundering in with your size 12s.

154
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,155
You are so two-faced. Why haven't you got the
guts just to tell the dude nobody likes him.

155
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,557
Oh, yeah. Great. Brilliant.
What am I supposed to say? "Excuse me, Rimmer.

156
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,759
"Do you know you're about as popular as a horny dog
at a Miss Lovely Legs competition"?

157
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,349
Well, that's what I'd do. I'd say...

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
Hi, buddy! How's it goin'?

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,676
Oh... I just had to get out of there. He's driving me nuts!

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,832
I cannot stand front-seat drivers.

161
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,470
Well, come on. There's not a lot going on in here.
We're on holiday! Let's cheer things up a bit.

162
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,077
How about some music?
I've brought my Hammond CDs with me.

163
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,359
How about "Reggie Wilson
Plays The Lift Music Classics"?

164
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,831
What about "Sounds
Of The Supermarket: 20 Shopping Greats"?

165
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,473
Has anyone seen the keys to the medical cabinet?

166
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,669
I feel a sudden urge to suffocate myself
with a two-pound black ribbed nobbler.

167
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,519
- Not Reggie Wilson please, Rimmer?
- You don't like Reggie Wilson? What?!

168
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,672
Not even "Pop Goes Delius"
or "Funking Up Wagner"?

169
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,551
I prefer something slightly more melodious,

170
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,157
like the long, drawn out death rattle of a man
suffering from terminal flatulence.

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,873
Come on, you bores. Let's do something.
How about we all sing some campfire songs?

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,350
# Kumbaya, my Lord

173
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,875
# Kumbaya... # Everyone. Kryten.

174
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,350
# Kumbaya, Kum... #

175
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,916
- Purple alert! Purple alert!
- What's a purple alert?

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,464
Well, it's sorta like not as bad as a red alert,
but a bit worse than a blue alert.

177
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,354
Kind of like a mauve alert. Well, I say mauve-

178
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,394
Holly, wipe the rabid foam
from your chin and start again.

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,793
There's some sort of disruption
to the time-fabric continuum.

180
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,474
At least, I presume that's what it is.
It's certainly got all the signs.

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,349
There's this big wibbly-wobbly swirly
thing and it's headed straight towards us.

182
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,716
What is it?

183
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,271
I don't know, sir. Which ever
way I manoeuvre it follows us!

184
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,229
It seems to be locked in on us. Wait. There's something's coming out of it.

185
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,034
It's going to hit us! Collision course!

186
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,513
(KRYTEN) Emergency! Emergency!
Adopt crash procedure!

187
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,155
- Where's the card. Who's got the card?
- What card?

188
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
The plastic card. The plastic card,
with cartoons of the crash procedure on it!

189
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,589
- Rimmer, don't panic, man!
- It should be in the netting behind the seats.

190
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,515
Haven't we got to sit behind a woman
clutching a baby? What's the drill?

191
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,472
- Look, I know what it is.
- What?

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,957
Sit down, tuck your head between your legs
and brace yourself.

193
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,433
- Now what?
- Then you open the in-flight magazine and start reading.

194
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,599
The dullness of the articles act as a sedative.
I mean, look at this contents list -

195
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,071
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight",
"Classic Wines Of Estonia",

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,834
"Flemish Weaving The Traditional Way"...

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,753
Don't fight it, man. Let it take you.

198
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,476
How can you be so mind-bogglingly flippant? Don't you
know what's going to happen? We're going to crash!

199
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,550
Look, you've got to stay calm. It's a well-known fact the
more relaxed you are, the less likely you are to be injured.

200
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,149
Good luck, everybody. Here it comes!

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,871
(CLATTER)

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,196
"The Ancient Egyptians were great believers in salt..."

203
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,997
"When most people think of classic wines,
they are unlikely to consider the Estonian reds,

204
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,313
yet Estonian grapes
are among the fruitiest and most subtle..."

205
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,353
"Since the beginning of the 13th century,
Belgium has been the home

206
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,559
of some of the most remarkable weaving
to come out of North-west Europe..."

207
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,555
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, thank God. I'm fine.

208
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,558
Cat!

209
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,473
It's bad, buddy. It's real bad.

210
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,917
See what I mean?
Red with apricot. I look like a jerk!

211
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm bleeding an unfashionable colour!

212
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,192
If I'd known I was going to get my leg crushed,
I'd have worn white. It goes with anything.

213
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,397
- Is anything broken?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,200
All the stitching's come away
and the lining's ripped.

215
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,556
Somebody, please! Get me a tailor!

216
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,954
Kryten, get the first aid box. We have to clean
this up, make sure he doesn't get gangrene.

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,589
Gangrene? You think I might get gangrene?

218
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,229
- Yeah. Shh!
- Hey, that might work!

219
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,040
Green with apricot - I think I could pull that off!

220
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,033
It's a break, sir. Quite a bad one.

221
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,797
I'll going to have to snap the bone
back into line, and there's no anaesthetic.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,389
Here. Read the in-flight magazine.

223
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight. The salt on a typ..."

224
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,639
- (CRUNCH)
- Oooh! My God!

225
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,354
- Did it hurt?
- No, I'm talking about the article.

226
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,716
Have you done my leg yet?

227
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,629
- Holly, what's the damage?
- It doesn't look good.

228
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,475
We've lost the port engine, the starboard engine's packed up, the fuel line's severed,

229
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,837
we're taking in water through the hull, we've lost the landing jets, half the electric's out,

230
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,190
and the elastic's snapped on the furry dice.

231
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,552
- What does that mean in real terms?
- Well, it means you've got a more tasteful cockpit,

232
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,918
but unless you fix that starboard engine in the next 40 minutes, we're going to start sinking.

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,178
Anything we can do?

234
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,398
We can try and hire a dance band
and get it to play "Abide With Me"?

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm going to have to go out there and fix the engine.

236
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,410
You don't know anything about engines!

237
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:10,313
Besides, there's a 40-knot gale out there.
You'd have to be insane to even attempt it.

238
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,233
Only a fool or a hero would even consider it.

239
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Bingo! Down there.
They've ditched into the drink.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,716
- I'm bailing out, Computer!
- (FEMALE VOICE) But, Ace, it's a suicide mission!

241
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,713
I caused the smash, should apologise.
Only manners.

242
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,635
- Bring her around for another pass.
- Please Ace, don't go. I love you.

243
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,476
Stiff upper modem, old girl.
Smoke me a kipper - I'll be back for breakfast.

244
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,515
Name's Commander Rimmer.
Arnold Rimmer. Friends call me "Ace".

245
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,439
I've come from another dimension. Explain later.

246
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,792
But first of all, let's get you out of this pit.
What do they call you, matey?

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,834
- Uh... K-Kryten, sir.
- Series 4,000 Mechanoid, am I right?

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,719
Salt of the Space Corps.

249
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,553
- Spanners.
- Eh?

250
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,434
I'm sorry, you reminded me of a fellow I once knew.
What's your handle?

251
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,831
- Lister. Dave Lister.
- Of course it is. Put it there, Dave.

252
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,359
You look a great bloke to be in a scrape with.
What about the guy in the sharp suit?

253
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,511
He hasn't got a name, we just call him Cat.

254
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,469
Looks like you've bought yourself a broken
leg there, Cat. I love the Cuban heels.

255
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,069
Who's the deeply delicious,
stunningly gorgeous computer?

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,271
Holly.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,280
God, it's me, only much more handsome.

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,155
Well, it looks like I'm superfluous.
Old Arnie'll have you out of here in no time!

259
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,355
- He's a hologram. He can't touch anything.
- Dead, eh? Well, Commiserations, old man.

260
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,712
- What a crushing bore that must be.
- You're me?

261
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,430
Don't quite understand the science, but it's got
something to do with us living identical lives

262
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,800
up until a certain point, where a decision was made
and you went one way, I went the other.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,595
Still, can't hang around here chinwagging all day.
Let's get this box up into the air, shall we?

264
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,912
- What's your plan, Arn?
- I...haven't got one.

265
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,954
OK. Right. well, um...

266
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,239
I suggest this - the starboard engine is repairable,
but it's a two-man job. Any volunteers?

267
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,910
Yeah, OK. Count me in. I've got a window
in my schedule this afternoon.

268
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,636
Not so fast, Davey boy. You leapt in so quick, you didn't give Arnie here a chance to speak.

269
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,470
- He was just about to volunteer, weren't you, Arn?
- No, I wasn't.

270
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,434
OK, well, um... let's get cracking, shall we, Dave?

271
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,280
What's the starboard engine's
thrust-to-input ratio, Arn?

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,909
- What's that?
- Well, you can work it out.

273
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,550
- What's the craft's inertia rating?
- I don't know.

274
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,950
- Well, what's the PSI?
- I don't know!

275
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,836
OK, we'll work it out when we get there shall we? Come on, Dave.
Better grab a brolly. There's a bit of a drizzle outside.

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,791
- Sir, can I have a word in private?
- Of course, old friend. Excuse us.

277
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,509
- What's the prob, Kryters?
- Well, I have a limited understanding of medicine, sir,

278
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,913
but it's plainly obvious even to me
that your left arm is broken in several places.

279
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,316
Took a bit of a tumble in the landing. It's only a scratch.

280
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,990
I cannot allow you to go out in this storm, sir. Not with your arm in that condition.

281
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,040
- I must insist you allow me to go in your place.
- I see.

282
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,398
- The Series 4,000 isn't waterproof, is it?
- Well, that's besides the point, sir.

283
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,597
Look, I'll tell you what we'll do...

284
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,353
Sorry, old chum, no option.

285
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,315
Arnie, Kryten's taken a bit of a whack. I want you
to reroute his circuitry and bring him back on-line.

286
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,638
- How?
- You don't know how to do that?

287
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,274
No.

288
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,558
Come on, Dave. Let's catch a breath of fresh air.

289
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,991
Smoke me a kipper... Can you do that?

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,350
I'll be back for breakfast.

291
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,549
(WIND HOWLS)

292
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
- What's your favourite music, Dave?
- Eh?

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,196
Keeps your spirits up if you sing a song.

294
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,431
- I like Rastabilly Skank.
- Right.

295
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,478
Aaaah!

296
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,952
Grab my arm, Dave! Grab my arm!

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,995
'Fraid I'm going to have to do
something a bit sissy now - black out.

298
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,356
Sorry about that. Let's get cracking!

299
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,159
# Whether you like rastabilly... #
Go on, Dave! Sing that song!

300
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,510
# Whether you like rastabilly... #

301
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,318
Paisley with stripes... That's nice...

302
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,831
Green anoraks with furry collars... They're great!

303
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,838
Oh, sir! He's delirious!

304
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,559
Oh! Rubber trousers,
held down with bicycle clips... Wow!

305
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,196
"Commander Rimmer." I ask you.

306
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,311
"Ace." Barf city!
I bet you anything he wears women's underwear.

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,472
They're all the same, his type, y'know? - hurly-burly,
rough-and-tumble macho marines in public,

308
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,190
and behind closed doors,
he'll be parading up and down in taffeta ball gowns

309
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,715
drinking mint juleps, whipping the houseboy.

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,471
Sir, he's you! It's just that your lives
diverged at a certain point in time.

311
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,910
Yes, I went into the gents and he went the other way.

312
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,357
I assume sir, you are making
fatuous references to his sexuality.

313
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,114
- If I may just point out...?
- Yes! We did it!

314
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,598
(BOTH CHANT) Awooga, awooga, awah, awah!
Awooga, awooga, awah!

315
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,519
What a team! How you got that housing clear, I'll never know.

316
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,792
Oh, come on, Ace, it was you! I could never have reconnected that fuel line.

317
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,573
Well I wouldn't have been able to do it
if you hadn't been holding me by the ankles.

318
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,520
How could you hang upside down AND fix the starboard engine. It was totally brutal.

319
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,484
- What a team!
- What a team.

320
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,718
Now I know where I've seen you two.

321
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,073
Weren't you the double-action centrefold
in July's edition of "Big Boys In Boots"?

322
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,990
Now, look here, Arnie. You can say what you like about me,
but I won't hear a word against Skipper, here.

323
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,271
- "Skipper"?!
- Man like him deserves a nickname.

324
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,954
- I thought "Skipper" sat rather well.
- "Ace" and "Skipper"?!

325
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,358
You sound like a kids' TV series
about a boy and his bush kangaroo!

326
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,953
Don't listen to him, Skipper. Let's get this tea chest
up into the stars and back to the small rouge one, eh?

327
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,031
Yeah, the sooner we get back, the sooner you two can climb
into a nice hot soapy bath and play "spot the submarine".

328
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,911
Sir, the Cat -
I don't think he's going to last much longer!

329
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,394
Bri-nylon underwear... Sock suspenders...

330
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,155
- Suits with cardigans!
- Oh, Sir, he's delirious! His leg's all swollen.

331
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,119
- I think- I think he may lose it.
- (LISTER) Lose his leg?

332
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,511
I fear so. The operation to save it is beyond my expertise.

333
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,354
Lose my leg? Hey, that's terrible.

334
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,875
None of my suits will fit!

335
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,799
Kryten, I'll need 500ccs
of corticoadrenaline, two pints of plasma,

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,157
a laser scalpel and some kind of tissue sample, a Macro-Bollington will do.

337
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,271
Oh, my God.

338
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,475
Field microsurgery - all part of basic training
in the Space Corps Special Service. I'll go scrub up.

339
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,990
I'll go and throw up.

340
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,200
- How's the Cat?
- Oh, Ace did it.

341
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,035
Cat's fine now. He's just sitting up in bed
looking through some swatches,

342
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,158
trying to find a material he likes for his dressings.

343
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,315
I don't know how Ace does it. He's been on his feet
for 36 hours, he's still laughing and joking.

344
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,154
What a guy.

345
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,836
He's just nipped off to teach Kryten
how to play the piano. Amazing dude.

346
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,873
So, is it a simple registry office
or a full church do for you two?

347
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,196
I don't understand your attitude, Rimmer. He's you!

348
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,873
He's not me! I'm me! He's a me who had all the luck,
all the chances, all the breaks that I never got.

349
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,750
No, it was just a single incident, and your lives
went off in completely different directions.

350
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,193
It's incredible to think that one decision in your childhood
could produce such drastically different people.

351
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,230
Right. He probably got to go to some really great
school, while I was lumbered with lo House.

352
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,673
He got to meet all the right people,
greased his way up the old boy network,

353
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,874
towel-flicked his way into the Space Corps,
Masonic-handshook his way into flight school

354
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,879
and brown-tongued his way up the ranks.

355
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,864
You would think you'd be pleased that somewhere
in some other dimension there's another you.

356
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:21,588
Another you doing really well for himself.

357
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,751
Oh, come on, how would you feel if some git
arrived from another dimension,

358
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,279
another Lister, with wall-to-wall charisma
and a PhD in being handsome and wonderful?

359
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,074
Hey man, I AM that Lister!

360
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,436
No, come on. How would you feel if there was another
Lister doing a hell of a lot better than you are?

361
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,554
There IS. Ace knows him.
That's why he called me Spanners when he first came in.

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,280
In Ace's dimension, he's a flight engineer in the Space Corps

363
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,751
married to Kristine Kochanski,
twin boys, Jim and Bexley.

364
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,993
I'm made up for him.
Whatever he did that I didn't, he deserves the lot.

365
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,633
For me, it kinda makes sense of a load of stuff, to think
that in all these dimensions every possibility is played out.

366
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,680
Hell, there's probably a really, really weird dimension
where you're better-looking than me.

367
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,754
Well, it just makes me bitter. You know I've
always had this thing about not getting the breaks.

368
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,959
Well, there's living proof of what I could
have achieved if I got the one he got.

369
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,671
- (ACE) Skipper, got a mo?
- Go on. He's probably picked a ring.

370
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,920
Skipper, I've decided I'm not going to stay.

371
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,391
- Why?
- Him and me. It would never work.

372
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,760
I just can't stand to be near the man. To see myself so
warped, so bitter, so weaselly. The man's a maggot.

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,473
- So where are you going to go?
- Just out there.

374
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,951
I can't go back, but there's a
billion other realities to explore,

375
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,350
a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet.

376
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,195
Maybe somewhere there's one who's more of a
pain in the butt than him... but I doubt it.

377
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,153
Well, good luck, man.
Now look, don't be too hard on Rimmer.

378
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,550
You got the break, he didn't, he's just bitter.

379
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,109
Do you know what that break was? At the age of seven,
one of us was kept back a year, the other one wasn't.

380
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,715
Put your finger on that, will you, Skipper?

381
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,589
That's the only difference?
Rimmer went down a year and you stayed up?

382
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,469
No, I was the one who went down a year.

383
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,672
By his terms, he got the break,
but being kept down a year made me.

384
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,629
The humiliation, being tallest
boy in the class by a clear foot.

385
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,633
it changed me, made me
buckle down, made me fight back.

386
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,114
- And I've been fighting back ever since.
- While he spent the rest of his life making excuses.

387
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,798
Maybe he's right. Maybe I did get the lucky break.

388
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,909
I'll grab my things and be off, Dave. Smoke me a kipper, Skipper,
I'll be back for breakfast.

389
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,398
Ready?

390
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,870
I'll smoke him a smegging kipper.

391
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,593
Now!
