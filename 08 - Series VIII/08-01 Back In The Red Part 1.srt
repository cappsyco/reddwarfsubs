("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,552
Remember Argyle Somerfield,
the old movie star?

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,236
83, according to this. He's
just had a baby with his nurse.

4
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,438
"It was love at first sight," she cooed.
"I've always liked older men.”

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,070
God, if she ever met Tutankhamen,
he wouldn't stand a chance.

6
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,557
She'd have his bandages off
before he could say "Silicone implants"!

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,951
There's a picture of them
here with their newborn.

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,431
There's Argyle, and there's the baby.

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,714
No, no no no... THERE'S Argyle and THERE'S the baby.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,714
I was thrown for a minute by the bib and the bonnet.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,030
I thought it was the baby at first.

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,632
An 85-year-old dad?!

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,631
How's that gonna work?

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,870
I bet he's gonna get up in the middle of the night
to help give the baby its feed.

15
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,270
He'll probably pretend to be dead.

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,949
"Darling, can you feed the baby his bottle tonight?"

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,591
It's not gonna work, is it?

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,195
The only advantage, as far as I can see,

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,752
is the wife can change both their nappies
at the same time!

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,236
Are you still not talking to me?
It's unbelievably childish, you know.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,314
I've a good mind to fill your shoes
with runny porridge again.

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,154
That'd teach you a lesson about maturity.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,431
All right, I tell you what. I bet I can
make you say something in the next minute.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,714
20 big ones.

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,834
Shake on it.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,833
All right. If I'm on, say nothing.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,959
I'm on!

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,519
OK.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,631
I'm going to say something , alright? And you're going
to totally lose it. Are you ready? Ready?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,952
All right. Several years ago, when money was not
abundant, and I needed, I mean, medically needed a pint...

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,831
I took some money from your purse.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,310
(GROANING)

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,312
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,790
Oh God, it was horrible going in there.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,679
The wallet that time forgot!

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,231
Not that there was any point.
The barman on B Deck wouldn't serve me.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,392
Said doubloons weren't legal tender any more.

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,996
He said you should have handed
them in after the Spanish Armada!

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,919
I thought I'd get you going.
You hate digs about your stinginess.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,951
It usually makes you so agitated that you've gotta go
and make a cup of tea with a brand-new tea bag!

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,350
Well, still... Plenty of time to go.

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,357
(LAUGHS)

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,315
Remember Yvonne McGruder?

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,234
You really liked her, didn't you?

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,429
I used to go out with her, y'know? - before you did.
You didn't know that, did you?

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,958
Broke up in the end. Really hurt me.
Still got the scars today.

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,197
They never heal, carpet burns, do they?

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,117
Both cheeks, man!

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,238
She nearly wore them down to the bone!

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,791
(SCREECHES)

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,394
Will you shut up?!

52
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,551
What did I tell ya?

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,518
20 big ones.

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,594
I've listened to you wittling on now
for what seems like two ice ages.

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,592
My mind is so numb and braindead

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,391
I feel like I've attended a three-day
seminar entitled 'The Future of Plumbing'.

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,436
Have you any idea how
irritating you've just been?

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,310
You're a master. There are things
you could teach to tropical skin diseases.

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,835
- Well, talk to me, then.
- No!

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,992
Look, I'm sorry, OK. How many times
do you want me to say it?

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,436
- I am sorry!
- No, you're not.

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,116
- It was an accident.
- An accident? You poured a whole tube of it over me,

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,717
you disgusting, rotting, fetid
piece of congealed monkey vomit!

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,114
Oh, at last you're talking to me.
I knew we'd make it up.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,518
83?!

66
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
(CAT) It seems even bigger than I remember.

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,359
Er... guys, we got a problem!

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,964
Hey guys, look at me body.

69
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:57,431
There's an invitation that
will not cause a stampede!

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,399
- No, it's back to normal.
- No time for that now ,sir.

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,079
We're flying down a corridor on Red Dwarf,
and Starbug appears to be expanding!

72
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,914
It's not Starbug that's expanding.
It's Red Dwarf that's shrinking!

73
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,755
It must be something to do with the nanobot's
molecular process, just like my body.

74
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,838
We're being sucked into a vent. I can't fight it.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,277
- (KRIS) Air-vent walls closing in.
- We must action, be bold, positive, decisive.

76
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,195
- Suggest we move from blue alert to red alert, sir.
- Forget red.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,432
Let's go all the way up to brown alert!

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,476
There's no such thing as brown alert.

79
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,950
You won't be saying that in a minute!

80
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,356
And don't say I didn't alert you.

81
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,512
All right, dudes. Anyone fancy
a game of charades using just your nose,

82
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,594
- or is this a bad time?
- Holly, we're about to get crushed to death!

83
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,751
So that's a no, then, is it?

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,831
Once the nanos rebuilt the ship,

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,654
I thought things were
going to get back to normal.

86
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,836
We don't know where we are, what to
do, and haven't a clue what's happening.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,832
Things ARE back to normal.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,196
You don't even fancy a bit of a quick one?

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,074

name of the ship, one word.

The Nostrilomo!

92
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,835
Spent a week thinking that one up.

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,320
Good, innit?

94
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,575
Computing time to impact. Calculations
coming through. Here they come.

95
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,758
How long have we got?

96
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,580
About the time it takes
to read a stop sign, sir.

97
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:39,433
That's OK then. I don't always
get through those in one sitting.

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,492
What are our chances
of getting out of here?

99
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:47,915
About the same odds as discovering Mr Lister
saddle-stitching the hem of a pair of lemon maternity slacks.

100
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,392
I must admit, it's been a while since I did that.
Can't you get this crate to go faster?

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,998
It's gonna be like getting crushed
to death by a gigantic trouser press!

102
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,953
Freshly laundered
and wrinkle-free.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,477
- I always prayed I'd go out like that.
- There may be a way through this if we take a detour.

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,161
Go past Epsilon 14 and take a right at the
hydro unit, we'll save about two minutes.

105
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:14,072
What do you say, sir? I don't understand a woman who's
hurtling towards 30 and still has a teddy called Boo-Boo.

106
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,199
- But when it comes to navigation, there's none finer!
- What's your view, Hol?

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,830
Straight up your nose
when you lean in like that.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,638
Epsilon 14.

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,353
There's some kind of heartbeat up ahead.

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,435
- And it's beating at an incredible rate.
- You mean there's a heart out there with no body?

111
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,557
No wonder it's beating so fast!

112
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,318
(THROBBING HEARTBEAT)

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,629
Hope we don't get stopped by the cops.

114
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,679
They don't like it when you're rat-arsed.

115
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,871
According to the desk we've lost all engines.

116
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,911
Hey, didn't I read somewhere
that can seriously affect your ability to fly?

117
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
Now we've lost the midsection and the kitchen.

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,473
I'm sorry, everyone, but we may have
to have sandwiches for lunch.

- Dave?
- Selby...

122
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,915
Chen... Is it really you?

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,036
Is it really us? Hang on. I'll check.

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,551
- Think it's us.
- Guys, this is brilliant.

125
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,315
- I can't believe it!
- You know these people, sir?

126
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,711
Know them? When they've been drunk
and unconscious,

127
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,111
I've taken their clothes off and painted
parts of them green. Of course I know them!

128
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,476
This is the Red Dwarf crew, Krytie!

129
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,917
- How?
- The nanos must've resurrected them along with the ship.

130
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,960
This is Chen. He works in the
kitchen and he's always drunk.

131
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,114
And this is Selby, and he's always drunk, too.
Where's Petersen?

132
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,600
He couldn't make it.

133
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,831
He's drunk!

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,790
The crew are all alive. Great news.
wonderful, marvellous, incredible news.

135
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,793
All that extra ironing - bliss!

136
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,158
Mr Thornton, read them their rights.

137
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,956
David Lister, you are formally charged
with stealing and crashing a Starbug,

138
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,264
You are also charged with
having no pilot's licence,

139
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:42,911
and smuggling two stowaways onboard along
with Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski.

140
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,995
Anything you say now or do not say now may be
used by the board of inquiry against you.

141
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,390
Do you require any form of aid?

142
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,030
Yeah, lemonade and a really large Scotch.

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,316
Left, right, left, right...

144
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,633
- Relax. You're gonna burst a blood vessel.
- Shut up you maggot Do you understand?!

145
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,677
- Do you understand?!
- Yes.

146
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,160
Yes, what?

147
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,518
- Yes, Mr Shouty.
- Yes, sir! Left, right, left, right...

148
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,596
... left, right. Halt!

149
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,751
Left arm.

150
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,959
At ease.

151
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,431
(HOLLY) All right, dude?

152
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,118
They don't know about you yet, Hol. It might be
an idea to keep it that way. I need some info.

153
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,159
If the board of enquiry finds us guilty tomorrow, what happens then?

154
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,076
Well, they'll probably have a pot of tea,
a bit of a chat and go home, I suppose.

155
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,800
What happens to us, you divvy, not them!

156
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,032
Well, if you lose, you'll probably get a couple of years in the brig.

157
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,191
- What brig?
- The brig on floor 13,

158
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,398
- There isn't a floor 13.
- Yeah, there is. It was classified,

159
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,358
A need-to-know-only basis.

160
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,557
- So who knew?
- Well all the officers,

161
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,315
and anyone who's ever seen
"The Twilight Zone".

162
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,471
So what's it like, this brig?

163
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,396
If I was an estate agent, I'd probably describe it
as an old-style penal establishment,

164
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,949
abundant wildlife, 200 bedrooms

165
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,634
all with en suite buckets.

Smegging "ell!

167
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,311
They call it the Tank.

168
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,111
There was an inmate population of 400
all being transported to Adelphi 12

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,992
- Presumably they've all been resurrected, too.
- What are they like? No, don't tell me I already know.

170
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,898
They're all deranged, hairy no-lobers, breath
like old nappies, arms like toilet walls,

171
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:32,395
scum-of-the-universe,
they're all like that aren't they?

172
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,358
Well, the nice ones are, yeah.

173
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,832
Hang on. I've got one of them on file
somewhere. Here we go.

174
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm Nigel.

175
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,913
I'm nice.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,470
See what I mean? They're not all headbangers.

177
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,556
Nige is lovely.
Though he does tend to get a bit narky

178
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,792
if you go too close to him with a magnet.

179
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,239
Thanks, very much Hol.
You're really cheering me up (!)

180

Two years!

182
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,510
Two years without curry and lager!

183
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
Two years without sex!

184
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,549
You hope.

- Rimmer!
- Words out, they're gonna throw the book at you, Listy,

186
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,192
followed by the bookcase and then the library, brick by brick.

187
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,556
God, it's you like you used to be.

188
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,438
Uugh...

189
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,069

You're a technician. A zero. A nobody.

190
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,956
Look, this is gonna sound nuts, but
the whole crew died, including you,

191
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,511
and you've all been resurrected
by these microscopic little robots.

192
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
- I died?
- Yeah.

193
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,700
- All the crew died?
-Yeah.

194
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,909
And you're gonna spend
the next two years in the brig

195
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,357
with a load of Neanderthals
with badly spelt tattoos?

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,516
So where are we? Is this my heaven?

197
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,715
Look, a radiation leak wiped everybody out.
I survived ‘cause I was in stasis.

198
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,829
Then these nanos arrived, rebuilt the ship
and resurrected the crew.

199
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,620
So where are they?
- Dunno. Gone. Scarpered. Maybe I should take the Fifth.

200
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,631
The Fifth? If I were you, I'd take
the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth, too.

201
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,512
I've gotta track down these nanos to corroborate our
story, otherwise who will believe our defence?

202
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,958
Only meths drinkers and the Corn Circle Society.
I need your help, man.

203
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,876
- Me?
- Who else is gonna help me? I'm confined to quarters.

204
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,274
The minute I walk through that door, I get enough
wattage up me jacksy to light up the whole of Bootle.

has in store for your jacksy,

Why have the nanobots done this? Put us in this situation?

208
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,805
In the past, they've only
ever done things which have

209
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,072
ultimately benefited us. We
should take comfort in that.

210
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,056
- Like what?
- Like when they first stole Red Dwarf.

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,431
And took on a merry goose
chase halfway around the galaxy.

212
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,389
They led us to Legion,
where Mr Rimmer acquired a hard-light body.

213
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,436
Benefit.

214
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,110
And then they took us back to
Red Dwarf and rebooted Holly.

215
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,514
Benefit. And after that, they led you
to the temporal rip where you met me.

crash and we're having trouble rebooting.

- Well, before you were resurrected,

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,152
I was alive, died, and then started living again.

322
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,711
- You've been most fortunate, sir.
- I have, haven't I?!

323
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,953
(CHUCKLES) Golly. Your chair IS
screwed down, isn't it, Kryten?

324
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,192
- Yes, sir.
- Just checking. Excellent. Lovely. Lovely...

325
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,078
So...

326
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,993
How did I suddenly spring back to life again?

327
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,994
You were rebuilt, sir, by these teeny-weeny
teenty little robots.

328
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,357
- Teenty little robots?
- And they make this little noise.

329
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,318
(SQUEAKS) Mini-mini-mini-mini-mini-mini

330
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,030
Yes. just double-check that
chair for me, would you, Kryten?

331
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,919
- It IS screwed down, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

332
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,869
with long, long screws
that go deep, deep into the ground?

333
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,917
Yes, sir.

334
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,632
Now, tell me. What kind of robot do you think
you are? What were you programmed to do?

335
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,954
I'm a sanitation droid, sir... I'm programmed to do sanitation-type
things - washing, cleaning, ironing.

336
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,353
You also drive spaceships though, don't you?
Pretend to be the science officer

337
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,037
and sit in that lovely, swivelly chair
with those lovely, pretty buttons and press them all.

338
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,713
Yes, I do that too, sir.

339
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,952
- That's sort of thanks to Mr Lister.
- Mr Lister?

340
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,171
He helped me break
my programming, sir.

341
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:39,557
Over the years, I've managed to develop some serious
character faults of which I'm extremely proud.

342
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,360
I'm even able to lie to a modest standard.

343
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,273
For example: you have a very fine haircut.

344
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,511
(LAUGHS)

345
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,559
You see how good I've got?
Also, I've completely mastered pomposity,

346
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,155
even though I say so myself.

347
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,632
I've also developed several
rudimentary emotions, including fear...

348
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,553
(SHRIEKS) Oh, my God. It's going to kill us!

349
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,951
Sadness... (QUIETLY) Oh, my God. It's killed us.

350
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Happiness...

351
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,833
Oh, no, it hasn't!

352
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,356
Surprise...
(SQUEALS) Ooh! I've turned into a frog!

353
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,120
And just lately, I'm proud to say, I've got the hang of anger
with rudimentary mindless violence. Arrgh!

354
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,999
That's a newie.

355
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,516
I was gonna launch it
at this year's emotion show.

356
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,433
At the moment, I'm working on ambivalence,

357
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,753
which means feeling two opposite
irreconcilable emotions about the same thing.

358
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,309
(GROANS)

359
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,670
As you can see, I haven't got the hang of that one yet.

360
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,878
I look like a dog with a caramel toffee.

361
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,720
- What is your relationship with Lister?
- I love Mr Lister, sir. He taught me everything.

362
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,554
Without him, I'd probably be normal.

363
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,074
I'm gonna make a recommendation now, Kryten,
which I think will help you,

364
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,473
but just before I do, just double-check
that chair for me, would you?

365
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,079
(TAPPING KEYS)

366
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,113
Yes!

367
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,917
Luck virus? Sexual magnetism?

368
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,351
- (BEEP)
- Holly, what's this?

369
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,434
They got them years ago
from this scientist called Lanstrom.

370
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,800
They're positive viruses. One gives you
sexual magnetism, and the other gives you luck.

371
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,839
Well, till your natural body defences combat the virus.

372
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,833
Sexual magnetism!

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,914
- Are you gonna use it?
- Is Paris a kind of plaster? You bet I am!

374
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,720
A tiny swigette to see if it works.

375
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,871
Well, bottoms up.

376
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,151
Then bottoms down,
and hopefully, bottoms up again!

377
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,311
(ALL) Hi there!

378
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,753
Ladies?

379
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,911
Hi, Arnold.

380
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,674
The world loves a bastard!

381
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,871
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

382
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,351
# I'm all alone, more or less

383
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,717
# Let me fly far away from here

384
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,520
# Fun, fun, fun

385
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,355
# In the sun, sun, sun

386
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,797
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

387
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,998
# Drinking fresh mango juice

388
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,516
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

389
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,354
# Fun, fun, fun

390
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,990
# In the sun, sun, sun

391
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,993
# Fun, fun, fun

392
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,677
# In the sun, sun, sun #
