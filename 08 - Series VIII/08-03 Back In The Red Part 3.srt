("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,279
One day in this lousy, stinking penal colony,
and I'm cracking up.

3
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,798
Everyone's so deranged and brutal,
it's frightening. This afternoon I was so depressed,

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,793
- I went to see the social worker.
- Was he any help?

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,554
Not really. He beat me up.

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,191
He said I was a whining nancy boy
with girly white legs,

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,673
then pummelled me repeatedly with his book
"Showing Compassion to Inmates".

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,959
- I thought social workers were supposed to be nice.
- In the end, I was so shellshocked,

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,192
- I went to see the priest and explained everything.
- What did he say?

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,354
He said I was a whining baby
who was missing his mum.

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,114
Then he beat me up, too.

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,875
You can still see the crucifix marks
in the back of my head.

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,271
It's 'cause we're in G tower.
All the staff are mad here.

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,879
One guys was saying though, said as a reward for good
behaviour, they move you to the luxury block on D wing.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,558
Everything's really nice there. They even shampoo the rats -
groom their tails and everything.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,554
I must look it up
in my "Michelin Guide to Penal Hellholes".

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,792
I'm sure it probably gets the full five slop-out buckets.

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,238
They've got everything. TVs, music centres.
They've even got a trouser press.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,551
Since when were you interested
in a trouser press?

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,669
You care less about your appearance
than a member of the Dutch Royal Family.

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,196
No, I was thinking, if we got moved to a cell
with a trouser press,

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,113
we could make cheese toasties.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,400
What's this?

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,112

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,071
What's the book?

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,878
"Gideon's Bible."

28
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,429
He follows me everywhere, that bloke.

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,355
I was staying in a hotel once -
he left his bible behind there as well.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,753
Two years later, another hotel,
dozy git left it behind again.

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,271
Everything is ruined. My career's over.
I've no goal, no hope, no life.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,432
Yeah, but how come that's
starting to get you down now?

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,152
Maybe you haven't noticed, but we're
gonna spend two years in the brig?

35
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,990
Two years with the
scum of the universe -

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,631
hardened criminals, deranged droids -
people so unbalanced and debauched,

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,829
they couldn't even get elected as president
of the United States. We've got to escape.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,277
No, there's security cameras everywhere.

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,877
You know that mad geezer with the one eye
and the funny tic? He said it was impossible.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,351
Well, he's bound to say that, he was the warden.

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,076
If only I'd hired a smarter lawyer instead of the
brain-dead, pompous, stupid-haired git I ended up with.

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,032
You defended yourself!

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,795
Yes, and I don't need reminding of that,
thank you very much.

44
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,033
- Two years in the Tank.
- Two years.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,310
How did I get into this mess?

46
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,393
I think the blindfold's supposed to be for me.

This is the diary of Captain F. Hollister
of the mining ship Red Dwarf.

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,677
Several of my crew are presently being tried
for crimes against the Space Corps.

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,437
- Are you familiar with the mind scan?
- We are familiar with the mind scan, sir.

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,796
You understand it will involve the administration

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,273
of psychotropic drugs, that is, drugs which affect
your mental state, making this process possible.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,795

We reconvene at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,754
To test the veracity of their defence, unknown to them
I've had them placed in artificial reality

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,434
where their actions can be observed.

("Little Green Bag" by George Baker)

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,117
Right now, they believe they're escaping,
but we just want to observe what they do.

60
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,877
So that means that if anyone happens
to mention any special agreements

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,035
that they've entered into... Could you excuse me?
I think I've... left the iron on.

62
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,954
Rimmer, one of the least able of my crew...

63
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,589
..has started acting very suspiciously,
being incredibly insightful and efficient.

64
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,960
I suspect he may have access
to the crew's confidential files.

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,475
We also believe he may in possession of a virus

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,474
which makes him incredibly attractive
to the opposite sex.

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,961
This is obviously a remarkable serum, and as a
responsible senior officer of the Space Corps,

68
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:58,635
it is imperative I gain possession
of this solution and use some myself.

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,235
Oh, my God, you are sexy!

70
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,438
So very, very sexy!

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,713
Yesterday, he was observed
injecting his groin with anaesthetic -

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
something we believe he
did to regain some self control.

73
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,151
- Hi.
- (ALL) Hi.

74
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,716
I also suspect someone, possibly Lister has given gave
Rimmer access to the crew's confidential files.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,397
He's using this information to blackmail
his way up the chain of command.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,030
It's sickening, it's unforgivable,
but it's a technique that can work.

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,194
I should know. I used the same method myself
to become captain.

78
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,833
If the crew discover I'm really
just Dennis the doughnut boy, I'm finished.

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,672
I will continue to observe Lister's actions in AR,

80
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,071
and expect my suspicions to be confirmed.

- I can handle this thing OK. I'm good.

Well, that's as maybe, but I need a
little proof that you can fly that thing.

- No one's allowed in there, Rimmer. Beat it.

it'll get cut, too - so i'm not going to, but it's him.

I know it's him, you can bet on it, and if I ever catch up
with him, I'm gonna cut off both his...

145
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,070
- So, how do we stop it?
- If we're plugged into AR software,

146
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,551
there must be a trapdoor built into the
program somewhere to allow escape.

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,473
- You mean, to help you get out if the program freezes?
- Precisely. There'll be a cryptic clue around somewhere.

149
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,075
something like a trapdoor or exit.

150
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,671
I got it!

151

- There's a button here with E-11-T on it.
- And?

Well somehow, we've wound up in the screen saver.

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,079
We need to locate a power source
so we can switch the AR machine off.

round here somewhere.

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,471
Maybe it's in this ice hole.

163
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,511
(ROARS)

164
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,440
Bleugh!

165
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,998
There's some food in here.

166
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,238
- So?
- Including a bottle of ketchup.

167
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,392
- So?
- Power ketchup, get it?

168
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,552
- What's to get?
- Power sauce!

169
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,078
- Pity he's only smart when he's made out of Plasticine.
- Press it.

170
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,073
Ooh.

171
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,674
(TAPPING KEY)

172
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,274
You backstabbing, weaselly smegger!

173
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,397
You were trying to frame us!

174
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,758
Listy, just the man.
I know at first glance it may look bad...

175
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,319
God, he's gorgeous!

176
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,836
- Oh, hold her back, please. No more.
- Oh, those nostrils.

177
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,509
They're driving me crazy.
I've simply got to have him.

178
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,233
Hold her back,
Kryten. Help me!

179
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,879
Put the Lift on hold.

180
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,791
I want his babies!

181
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,789
The luck virus. You still got it? Take some,

182
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,555
It'll cure the virus
and restore you both to normal.

183
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,437
Oh, God, that's so embarrassing!

184
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,114
- What now, Hol?
- No time to lose.

185
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,113
You should head for the nearest one of these...

186
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,273
- You mean a moon?
- Exactly.

187
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,831
He's right, we can regroup there
and continue our search for the Nanos.

188
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,406
What about me?

189
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,671
Well, suggest we persuade you to come with us,
sir, or failing that, we bludgeon you unconscious.

190
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,354
Him come with us? Are you out of your mind?!

191
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,670
That's so dumb, I should have said it!

192
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,152
Mr Rimmer has had access to the confidential files, sir.
He knows all the security codes.

193
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,358
Without him, our chances
of escape are as remote

194
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,990
as meeting an interesting hairdresser
called Kylie.

195
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,073
Why would I want to take off with you lot?
what have you got to offer?

196
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,278
Well, I'm very good at laundry, sir.

197
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,353
I do a damn fine moon impression.

198
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,315
I'm so gorgeous, there's a six-month waiting list
for birds to suddenly appear every time I'm near.

199
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,753
You know what they say, sir -
if you've got three good friends, you're a rich man.

200
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,438
- Only poor people say that.
- Forget it. He's not gonna change his mind.

201
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,958
He's right, time is of the essence.

202
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:57,515
The crew will know we're out of AR now and
are probably sending someone to investigate.

203
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,239
So, what's it to be?

204
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,112
Look, if I leave, I'm always going to be a failure. The
shame of it - every time I have a boiled egg,

205
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,557
knowing I don't even outrank
the toastie soldiers.

206
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,157
- I want to be an officer. A man of honour.
- Officers aren't men of honour, they're head cases.

207
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,631
Those induction pranks
they play when you qualify!

208
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,794
(SIGHS) I've dreamt of that proud day
for years now -

209
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,554
as I wake up after the celebration party

210
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,315
and find my pubes are orange
and I'm handcuffed to a goat.

211
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,626
And most hilarious of all, discovering
someone superglued me

212
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,795
 to the rear of one of those rabbits that
whizzes round greyhound tracks.

213
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,352
Ah! Those mad japes they play on you.
I can't miss all that.

214
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,798
That's not gonna happen for you now.
Just like it didn't happen for the other Rimmer.

215
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,554
We're giving you a second chance at life,

216
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,635
and an opportunity for you to screw it up
in a new and original way.

217
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,033
You'll get you're own seat in the cockpit
and you'll be in control of at least five buttons.

218
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,876
Krytie, don't be pathetic. He's hardly going to be impressed
at the prospect of being in charge of a few buttons!

219
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,714
Five, you say?

220
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,000
No more vending machine maintenance.
No more getting heckled by drinks dispensers.

221
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,231
That's five whole buttons?

222
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,596
A new start, a new life.

223
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,354
You'll wake up every morning, you'll wanna leap out of bed.

224
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,038
Well, in your case, Mr Lister, that's because your
sheets are covered in pointy poppadom shards.

225
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,318
Tell me more about these buttons.
Are some illuminated?

226
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,633
What do you say, man? The old Rimmer
was a vital member of the team.

227
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,316
He performed essential functions
we've never replaced.

228
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,834
What did he do?

229
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,991
Dunno, really.

230
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,549
He, um... He was, um...

231
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,037
Head of Safety.

232
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,831
Head of Safety? That's a hell of a title.
What did he actually do?

233
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,518
You sort out danger. You sort out peril. Then
you advise on the best way to run away from it.

234
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,112
Head of Safety, five buttons.

235
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm in!

236
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,990
He's in? Let's celebrate!

237
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,470
I'll crack open a bottle of cyanide.

238
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,190
This is ground control.
You don't appear to have flight clearance.

239
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,313
- You're the ground controller?
- Please state your name and clearance code.

240
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,153
Reality sucks!

241
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,158
Your name's Reality Sucks? (LAUGHS)

242
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,436
One second, Mr Sucks.

243
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,116
Just checking my clearance list.

244
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,155
- Look, just do another smegging dance and we'll go.
- Dance?!

245
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,630
With her, I'd have trouble walking!

246
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,916
I'm powering up.

247
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,151
Come back, Mr Sucks! Come back!

248
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,989
There's nothing on the scanners for
a 1,000-mile radius. We're in the clear, guys!

249
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,719
(ALL) Yes!

250
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,716
- I don't believe we are, ma'am.
- What's up?

251
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,897
According to the supplies
inventory, we're frighteningly low on...

252
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,752
Oh, and everyone was so
happy... I can barely say it out loud.

253
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:37,474
What are we frighteningly
low on? Oxygen?

254
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,029
Worse. Fabric softener!

255
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,118
Suggest we chart a course
to the nearest derelict - the SS Einstein -

256
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,193
before everyone's woollens get all bibbly-bobbly.

257
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,514
Einstein? Wasn't he the dude
who discovered America?

258
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,355
- Einstein discovered the theory of relativity.
- Where did he discover it?

259
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,034
Was it fossilized and stuff?

260
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,555
The theory of relativity is...

261
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,637
- What is the theory of relativity?
- Yeah, what is it, Hol?

262
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,671
Bit busy at the moment, Dave.

263
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,912
Just tell us what it is in, sort of, simple layman's terms.

264
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,071
It's a theory.

265
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,360
Yeah, but what is it?

266
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,353
Oh, you want it more complicated
than that, do you?

267
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,070
- What does it mean?
- It's the theory of relativity.

268
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,029
You know - it's a theory
you only tell your relatives.

269
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,759
It's so sad. Holly's supposed
to have an IQ of 6,000.

270
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,196
Now, I doubt he could even spell IQ.

271
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,797
If I'm so stupid, if I'm computer-senile,
explain this then.

272
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,120
Explain what?

273
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,396
You can't, can you?!

274
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,640
Explain what?

275
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,350
It's no good stalling, trying to buy time.

276
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
If I'm so stupid,

277
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,469
explain how was I able to recreate a new set
of Nanobots and get them to resurrect the crew?

278
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,039
(ALL) What?

279
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,271
I thought you'd be pleased.

280
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
But why?

281
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,991
My job is to keep Dave sane.

282
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,357
True, I'm not that good at it, but I do my best.

283
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,354
That's why I create these little
diversions to keep him occupied.

284
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,115
But Hol, we could have wound up
doing two years in the brig!

285
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,272
You still could. I've just worked it out.

286
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,919
We're still in AR.

287
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,832
(ALL) What?

288
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
In computer jargon,

289
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,949
my plans have all gone tits up.

290
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,357
- I was out-thought and outmanoeuvred,
- Who by?

291
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,830
By a superior intellect.

292
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,233
You mean the hand dryer in the
men's toilets has outsmarted you again?

293
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,353
No. By that other version of me -
the one on Red Dwarf. This is still our trial

294
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,636
Our trial? Why didn't you say?

295
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,155
If I'd known, I'd have worn a tie!

296
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,113
Well, for me. Lister's Nanobots story is corroborated. They were trying to track 'em down.

297
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,592
Their actions in the psychotropically
induced scenario bear that out.

298
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,353
I agree, Frank.

299
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,118
I also believe we died and were indeed
resurrected - again, borne out by their actions.

300
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,636
So, original charges - all innocent.

301
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,512
But it's equally apparent that they used classified
information from the crew's confidential files

302
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
to their own ends.

303
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,645
I suspected Rimmer had access
the moment he walked in to my office

304
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,509
and began acting incredibly
smart and knowledgeable.

305
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,751
What a giveaway!

306
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,111
That's why I got him to lick one of the psychotropic
envelopes when I invited him to dinner.

307
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,195
So, abusing classified information.
That's a fresh charge.

308
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,237
And on that, they're all guilty.

309
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,960
- That's a statutory sentence.
- I know.

310
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,680
Two years in the brig.

311
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,789
So instead of the original charge and a possible
sentence of two years in the brig,

312
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,156
they've been found guilty on another charge

313
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,551
and got an entirely different
two years in the brig.

314
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,234
That's gonna be a great comfort to them.

315
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,074
I'll bring them round and break the news.

316
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,955
- This is reality? But how can we be sure?
- Why do we care?

317
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,112
Nothing makes any sense
no matter where we are.

318
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,513
Look, everything was real
before we licked the envelopes, right?

319
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,593
Then we conked out and got carted off to AR.

320
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,751
Before we licked anything...

321
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,151
Before we licked anything,
I lent you my Holly watch.

322
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,952
So if this is reality, I should still be wearing it.

323
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,956
Oh, yeah. This is reality, all right.
I'd recognise it anywhere.

324
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,389
Also, sir. Shouldn't you have the viruses? Again, you found
them on Starbug before we licked the envelopes.

325
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,039
The luck virus.

326
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,271
Maybe we can get out of this mess.

327
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,149
I'll have that. The lab boys
are gonna want to run tests on it.

328
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,630
(CAPTAIN) Where's the other one?

329
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,950
I'm afraid I lost it, sir.

330
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,954
Goddammit, Rimmer! I wanted that...

331
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,671
I mean, the lab boys wanted it
to er, test it too. Damn!

332
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,836
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

333
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,913
You betrayed us over that confidential file scam.

334
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,152
- Stole the sexual magnetism virus.
- You lied to us.

335
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,871
And generally behaved like a self-serving,
scum-sucking, ruthless little rat bag!

336
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,951
And that's bad?

337
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,560
(CAPTAIN) It is the finding of this inquiry that you have been found guilty
of contravening Act 21 of the Space Federation.

338
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,352
Before sentencing, you will have medicals so
you can be assigned appropriate prison status.

339
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,115
I've buggered this up a bit, haven't I?

340
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,115
Welcome to the Tank.

341
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,555
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

342
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,997
# I'm all alone, more or less

343
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,232
# Let me fly far away from here

344
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,233
# Fun, fun, fun

345
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,916
# In the sun, sun, sun

346
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,436
# [ want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

347
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,638
# Drinking fresh mango juice

348
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,031
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

349
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,999
# Fun, fun, fun

350
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,551
# In the sun, sun, sun

351
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,599
# Fun, fun, fun

352
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,754
# In the sun, sun, sun #
