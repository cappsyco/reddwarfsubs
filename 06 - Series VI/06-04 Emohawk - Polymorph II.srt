("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,389
Scramble! Scramble! All hands
on deck! Emergency drill! Scramble!

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,194
Er, perhaps you didn't catch
that - I said SCRAMBLE!

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,313
Yeah, that would be great
with bacon and beans, man.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,272
Look, Starbug's a blazing inferno, the
engine rooms are waist deep in rocket fuel,

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,319
and we're being attacked off the
starboard bow by a unidentified craft.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,239
- Really?
- No, of course not really. It's a drill.

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,040
We're pretending Starbug's
on fire and under attack.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,596
And I'm pretending
to scramble, man. Goodnight.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,950
Look, you've got 30 seconds to get out of bed
or I'm declaring you officially dead.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,516
Good, then we can rest in peace.

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,316
Well, gentlemen, congratulations. Scrambling
in a Red Alert situation, a new record time -

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,677
1 hour, 17 minutes, 39 seconds.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,192
Hey, not bad. And I bet we could get it down to 1:16 if we cut out that fourth round of toast.

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,160
You think I'm a petty-minded
bureaucratic nincompoop,

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,309
who delights in enforcing
pernickety regulations

17
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,791
because he gets some sort
of perverse pleasure out of it,

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,516
and in many ways
you're absolutely damn right,

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,551
but that doesn't alter the fact that the
only way we're going to track down Red Dwarf

20
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:53,428
and get through this in one piece is
with a sense of discipline, a sense of purpose,

21
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:56,000
and wherever possible,
a sensible haircut.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,798
- I'm going back to bed.
- Would it harm you to have hair like mine?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,471
I have got hair like yours...
just not on my head.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,991
Well, I'm no stranger to the land of scoff.

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,629
Perhaps you would like to explain to me,
why it is that every major battle in history

26
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,838
has been won by the side
with the shortest haircuts.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,671
- Oh, surely not, sir.
- Think about it. Why did the US Cavalry beat the Indian Nation?

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,799
Short back and sides versus girly hippy locks.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,794
The Cavaliers and the Roundheads -
one-nil to the pudding basins.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,351
Vietnam, crew-cuts both sides -
no-score draw.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,359
Oh, for a really world-class psychiatrist.

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Check your screens. I'm getting something
up my left nostril and it's coming in fast.

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,918
Scans are all negative, sir. At the risk
of challenging your olfactory excellence,

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,276
perhaps a re-smelling is in order.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,829
I'm telling you bud, my
nostril hairs are shimmying

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,994
faster than a grass skirt on a
fat Hawaiian hula-hoop champion.

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,073
- There's something out there.
- Scan's still dry.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,631
That's it.
I'm invoking Space Corp Directive 68250.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,394
68250? But, sir, surely that's impossible

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,916
without at least one live chicken and a rabbi.

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,198
- Forget it. Forget I was ever born.
- Sir, I'm very happy to perform the ceremony,

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,230
but I'm absolutely bewildered as to how sacrificing
poultry might clear up the screen problem.

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,399
Wait a minute. Getting something.
Major power surge off the port bow.

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,319
He's right.
Some kind of vessel. It appears to be uncloaking.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,717
He's too damn close!
That power surge'll toss us around

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,157
like we're a bead of sweat in an
aerobics teacher's buttock cleavage.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,478
- Hang on. Here it comes.
- (RUMBLING)

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,910
- Damage report?
- Superficial.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
Navicomp's down, slight rupture in fuel pipe 9

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,749
and somehow the pilot's headset's got jammed
on the Country and Western Channel.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,797
Second wave coming!

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,751
(WHOOSHING)

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,794
What's he thinking of,
warping that close to another vessel? Damn space hog!

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,753
My god, that's a Space Corp
external enforcement vehicle.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,679
- What?
- The space filth.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,316
A computer-controlled enforcement probe.
It's scanning us now.

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,229
- Incoming.
- (COMPUTER) Property Corps Space removing and

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,550
equipment Corps Space damaging,

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,157
ships Corps Space of series a looting
with charged formerly are you.

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,119
The materialization must
have scrambled its voice unit.

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,399
It's making about as much sense
as a Japanese VCR instruction manual.

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,350
- Plead you do how?
- It's in reverse. "How do you plead?"

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,633
- How do we plead to what?
- It's charging us with looting Space Corps derelicts.

64
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,993
But we don't loot Space Corps derelicts.
We just hack our way in and swipe what we need.

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,238
Lister, if this goes to trial,
I demand separate lawyers.

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,152
What's the penalty for this? 'Cause if it means outfits
with arrows on, I'm committing suicide.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,753
Er, no, sir. It means wearing outfits with wings
and haloes on, sir. The penalty is execution.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,434
- Why so harsh?
- It's frontier law, sir.

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,910
We're the deep space equivalent of horse rustlers.

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,631
Severe sentencing is the only way
to maintain order. Don't expect it to show us any mercy.

71
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,871
- What do we do?
- Let's face it, sir, we're as guilty

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,839
as the man behind the grassy knoll.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,119
- Yeah, but if we admit it, it'll blow us out of the stars.
- Recommendations?

74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,799
Suggest I take the rap for everyone, sir. You can say that I held
you hostage and forced you at gunpoint to do my evil bidding.

75
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,679
- For God's sake, Kryten, we can't let you do that!
- Really?

76
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,597
Dream on, metal trash. Get your hands
in the air and step into that searchlight.

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,317
- Minute one have you.
- No choices then. We leg it. Plot a course for scarper city.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,677
Sir, a Class A Enforcement Orb can easily outrun us.

79
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,953
Kryten, the Eastbourne Zimmer frame
relay team can easily outrun us.

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,919
It's not about speed.
It's about wit, brains and cunning.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,556
- Hmm, I was praying it wouldn't come to that, sir.
- Take a look at your screens.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,509
We're seven klicks away from the GELF Zone.
It wouldn't follow us in there in a gazillion years.

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,953
No, because GELFs are untrustworthy scavengers
with no regard for life, law or property.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,913
- Right, so we'll be safe.
- Lister, you've heard the stories.

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,277
They skin human beings alive
and turn them into beanbags.

86
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,149
Unless you want a triple-buttocked GELF
sitting on your face for the rest of eternity,

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,473
probing your crevices for lost forks and biros,
I suggest you rethink.

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,076
It's the lesser of two evils, sir. In the absence
of a sane plan, I suggest we go with Mr Lister's.

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,831
Seconds 20 in firing commence will I,
reply a of absence in.

90
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,877
- Roughly translated, hit the reheat.
- You don't have to tell me twice...

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,031
Cat, hit the reheat!

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,318
Sorry, bud. Looks like you DO have to tell me twice.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,230
Firing commence will I or halt!

94
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,319
- In which case, Bony-butts our move let's!
- Close comms.

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,596
- Comms closed.
- GELF zone six clicks and closing.

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,997
- Weapon lock registered. Pulse missile launched.
- Impact in ten seconds.

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,034
- That's it. We're platform shoes, man.
- Firing chaff. Firing flares.

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,359
- Brace for impact.
- Missed us!

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,120
- Warning shot across the bow.
- Won't be so fortunate next time.

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,636
- Four clicks to GELF Zone.
- Another lock, this time it won't be a warning shot.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,871
- Incoming pulse fire.
- Decoys launched.

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,829
- It's not going to be enough! Six seconds to impact!
- We've gotta try and shake 'em off!

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,199
We've lost it.

104
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,832
Sorry, I was looking at the wrong panel.

105
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,712
Damage report?

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,475
It's bad, bud. Looks like Starbug's been hit.

107
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,833
- Details, halibut breath!
- Well, according to the damage report machine,

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,278
there are several small fires in the cockpit,
lots of smoke and the navicomp's fizzing.

109
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,678
Oh, damn!
Now the damage report machine's exploded.

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,235
- Another lock on!
- This one's to finish us off.

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,710
- How far to the GELF Zone?
- Click and a half.

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,703
We've lost three fuel tanks,
there's barely enough left to get us stable!

113
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,238
Wait! I'm picking
something up.

114
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,630
Got it. Putting it on visual.

115
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,992
Look at the size of that thing. It must be a mile across.

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,676
A GELF icon, carved out of a solid rock.
It's some kind of warning beacon.

117
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,236
- Hey, incoming message.
- (GRUFF VOICE) Kar nasa pinit.

118
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,631
- Wah twah morah!
- Running it through the translator.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,033
This is GELF space. Death to the strangers.

120
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,592
- Pulse missile launch. Impact in 12 seconds and counting.
- Cat, head for the eye socket.

121
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,990
- The eye socket?
- There's no way through it's a dead end!

122
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,589
- Just do it!
- Eight seconds.

123
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,236
- We're heading for solid rock.
- Three seconds... two... one.

124
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,557
- 80% of the manoeuvring thrusters are out.
- The infra-red reports 53 separate fires.

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,149
Sprinkler systems are down on
all three decks of the engine room.

126
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:45,199
There's no way to put it out. As
soon as it hits the fuel tanks, we'll blow.

127
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,157
Wait a minute! GELF moon bearing 356 by 121.
It's got an ocean. Can you get us there?

128
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,518
Does mouse shit roll? I'll get you there, bud.

129
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,992
Look at it.
All our possessions, all our valuables.

130
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,358
Between fire, flood and impact damage,
we've lost damn near everything.

131
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,309
Well, at least Mr Lister's guitar
survived intact.

132
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,637
Not even Mr Lister's guitar survived intact.

133
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,430
It's waist-high down there, but I
managed to get the pumps working again.

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,117
- Three hours and we'll be dry.
- Thrusters, boosters, reheat -

135
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,309
auto-repair can take care of everything, apart from
the oxy-generation unit which is totally kaputzki.

136
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,830
So you're saying we can take off but we can't breathe?

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,967
And we can't repair it?

138
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,914
It's a black and charred mess,
worse than one of Lister's drunken fry-ups.

139
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,476
Well, we're snookered...
unless we get out there and trade with the GELFs.

140
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,634
- Trade? You can't be serious.
- Sir, it does appear to be our only option.

141
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,391
(CRICKETS CHIRP)

142
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,954
Give me the arrow. It could tell us a whole heck of a lot about what we're dealing with here.

143
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,199
- Anything?
- Yep. This came from a bow, all right.

144
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,398
Sorry. I was expecting
a get lot more than that.

145
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,031
As we anticipated, they are the Kinitawowi.
Good. I have studied the dialect.

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,877
- They are one of the friendlier "kinteteach" or tribes.
- Nice welcome!

147
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:41,396
No, sir. It is a great 'hano' or
honour to be greeted in this manner.

148
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,269
They would have killed us the instant we
landed if they had taken exception to us.

149
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,752
- That's a very good sign.
- What? It's a good sign they haven't killed us?

150
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,771
Absolutely, sir.
With the Kinitawowi,

151
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:56,439
not skinning you alive the moment they set
eyes on you is one of their warmest greetings.

152
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,399
We are indeed "han hasset" or blessed.

153
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,112
And, Kryten, you are indeed a "hachum babow",
or smart alec metal git.

154
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,309
I will tell them we are traders in search of an engine
part and that we have many rare treasures to trade.

155
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,034
Kinitawowi,
nich niche histan kanoa nakoo bacoo.

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,715
Nuyer neeal dol dager.

157
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,110
Look. Look what we got.
We got Swiss watches. Nice watch.

158
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,271
Levi jeans!

159
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,435
Hey! A hat. Look at this.
Hey-hey-hey! Nice hat!

160
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,398
Cigar?

161
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,313
Hey! Cool dude!

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,720
Might I suggest caution, sir. Some GELFs have
their sphincteral orifices in their faces.

163
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,269
Let's hope you haven't offended him.

164
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,431
Oh, no, he seems quite pleased.

165
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,112
We need an oxy-generation unit, savvy?

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,800
Ogigon bachoo machwahah.

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,918
Ah. Aleesa. Alees tada.

168
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,071
Cat, get the case, man.

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,035
(GRUNTS) Machu, aloo atu ba ba.

170
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,029
- It seems to be going well.
- (CAT) What is that thing?

171
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,910
It's an emohawk, sir. A polymorph
that's spayed at birth and half domesticated.

172
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,431
It's trained
to change shape at its owner's behest.

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,551
Like all polymorphs it's an emotional leech.
It has the ability to steal emotions from living creatures.

174
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,320
Emotions are a highly valued
trading commodity.

175
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,871
- (LISTER) The oxy-generation unit.
- Looks like they're ready to fix a price.

176
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,634
I thought we'd fixed a price with all the
bangles and baubles we've given them.

177
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,475
Oh no, sir. That was just for the honour
of entering their "watunga" or hut.

178
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,955
- The bartering proper begins now.
- Rah! Rec raht wig dic anatu pata.

179
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,236
Oh, dear.

180
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,600
- What? what, you want my hat?
- Ah nu dewka ana weg bah.

181
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,873
- My jacket? You want my jacket?
- No, sir. He doesn't want your jacket.

182
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
- Not my longjohns does, he?
- Not your longjohns either, sir.

183
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,637
- Well, what then?
- Ahg nu dewka ana weg bah.

184
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,877
Me? He wants me?

185
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,911
Yes, sir. He says, in exchange for the oxy-generation
unit, he wants you to be his daughter's mate.

186
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,550
(LISTER) That's his daughter?!

187
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,960
One of three.
Apparently, sir, she's the looker.

188
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,998
Tell him not if she was the last warty yeti
lookalike in the world and I was the only boy.

189
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,430
Come on, Lister. You've dated worse.

190
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,552
Only due to very poor disco lighting.

191
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,109
Ana beg ewitah ogigon nich kawal bah.

192
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,709
He says no wedding, no OG unit.

193
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,877
Panta anag ew. Panta wa ah.

194
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,356
He's giving us five 'hanaka' to decide.

195
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,717
- How Long's a 'hanaka'?
- Curiously enough, it's exactly the same as one Earth minute.

196
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,914
Five hanaka. That only gives us 28 hours!

197
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,398
OK, look. Let's get out our sheet music
and play the Real Waltz.

198
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,949
There's no way I'm going down to Moss Bros

199
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,832
for anyone who is less attractive than
my own armpit after 20 games of table tennis.

200
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,043
What about us? You're not
gonna hang all of us out to dry

201
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:35,070
just because, for some reason,
she doesn't hit your G-spot.

202
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,120
What about sacrifice? Putting your friends'
interests before your own selfish drives?

203
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,952
Rimmer, it would never work out. She's
obviously an Aries. And me and Aries? Forget it.

204
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,551
Sir, they are proud people
and they will not change their mind

205
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,271
unless you are prepared to stay here
and marry Hackhackhackachhachhachach.

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,997
That's her name?!

207
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,951
I could never settle down with anyone whose
name sounds like a footballer clearing his nose.

208
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,949
The plan is obvious, we do the trade,
you go through with the wedding,

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,634
when everybody's asleep,
we come back and rescue you.

210
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,633
- What do you say?
- Not a chance in hell!

211
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,559
Ana dok kaz, ana dok wah, hah.

212
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,794
I do.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,072
Ana zun keh, zun keh atta.

214
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,989
- What's he saying?
- You may kiss the bride, sir.

215
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,151
What, without a bag?

216
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,439
Hey, don't be strangers, guys. See you soon.
Drop in any time... ANY TIME!

217
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,798
Hanibech yech, ogigon yech.

218
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,316
Well, darling... What a day.

219
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,030
I'm pooped. Straight to sleep for me.

220
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,069
(GROWLS) Nee bonnen nic partin.

221
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,598
Maybe in the morning. Goodnight.

222
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,358
You've been looking forward to this, haven't you?
You're not gonna take no for an answer, are you?

223
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,875
Nack hey.

224
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,195
OK, just give me a couple of minutes. I want to slip
into something a little bit more comfortable - it's called Starbug.

225
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,911
Change of plan! Leg it!!

226
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,434
- Wait! Something's coming.
- It's the emohawk!

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,434
- What happened? Where'd it go?
- It must have transmuted into something else.

228
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,353
Suggest we proceed with extreme caution.

229
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,150
It's somewhere close. I can smell it.

230
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,516
- It's the stick!
- (THEY ALL SCREAM)

231
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,675
No, it's not. Oh my God, I'm so jumpy.
I thought it was the stick.

232
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,109
- It is the stick!
- (THEY ALL SCREAM)

233
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,196
- (RIMMER) Where is it, now?
- It's gone off into the undergrowth.

234
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,516
Cat, you know what they're like.
Stay on the case, don't pick anything up.

235
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,876
Unbelievable, getting suckered like that.

236
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,750
- 100 per cent concentration at all times.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,590
(BEEPS)

238
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,479
That's it we're airtight. Damn thing can't get in now.

239
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,029
And all it took was a little bit of concentration.

240
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,608
How long before we can go?

241
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:42,758
We don't really want a visit from Listy's
in-laws demanding their wedding present back.

242
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,396
It'll take an hour or so to set the oxy-generation unit set up.

243
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,758
But I suggest we take off now, sir, and use
emergency supplies until the OG unit's online.

244
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,914
- What if it doesn't work?
- Then the Cat and Mr Lister will choke to death.

245
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,117
A plan with no drawbacks.

246
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,995
Time we fitted that OG unit.

247
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,310
- Kryters.
- I'm on my way, sir.

248
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,317
That smell is still driving me crazy.
I gotta wash my hands. Transferring to auto.

249
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,950
(SNIFFS)

250
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,390
(EMOHAWK GROWLS, CAT SCREAMS)

251
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,312
It's stolen my cool! It's taken all my style!

252
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,511
I need a mirror.

253
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,278
What's up with me? I got no grace, no élan, no poise!

254
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,310
What's it turned me into?!

255
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,552
Duane Dibbley?

256
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,518
Duane Dibbley?! (SCREAMS)

257
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,916
What is it? I heard noises.

258
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,671
Look what it's done to me! It's turned
me into Duane Dibbley, the Duke of Dork.

259
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,156
Oh, my God. Where is it?

260
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,159
I lost it. It came in here somewhere.

261
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,638
- Can you smell it?
- The only scent I'm getting is extra strong spot cream

262
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,189
and the dandruff shampoo that doesn't work.

263
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,951
It could be anywhere.
It could be anything. Trust nothing.

264
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,111
It may have outsmarted you,

265
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,037
but it's going to have to get up pretty darn early
in the AM to outsmart Arnie J.

266
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,033
Is that a new gun? I don't recall seeing it before.

267
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,589
The gun! The emohawk's the gun!

268
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,711
Phew! God, that was close.

269
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,915
I hope you're right, 'cause if you're
not, we just flushed away our only gun.

270
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,431
Just leave the thinking to me,
keyboard teeth.

271
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,915
Lister, Kryten, the Cat was right.
We had brought the emohawk on board.

272
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,358
But, lucky for you guys,
old iron-butt was around to sort it out.

273
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,639
That's weird. There's something wrong
with this microphone. It's not transmitting.

274
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,070
(HORRIBLE ROAR)

275
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,839
Are you OK, sir?

276
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,078
(RIMMER) It's removing my bitterness,
taking my negativity,

277
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,595
slurping out all my snidiness!

278
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,436
It's gone now, sir. It's OK to come out.

279
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,149
Cat, old man. Looks like we both
bought a bite from the little blighter.

280
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,836
Let's track it down
before it harms Kryters and Dave.

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,474
I'm afraid this means death for both of us,
but it's a small price to pay to save our chummies, eh?

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,631
What a guy! Listen...

283
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,312
Before we leave, I just gotta change these clothes.

284
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,715
If I don't get into some sideways-ironed flares and
transparent plastic sandals, I swear I'll go crazy!

285
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,915
Do what you have to, old chum.
I'll go tell them we're having a party.

286
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,271
- (THUD)
- What was that?

287
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,717
It's the hydraulic lock, sir. We're sealed in!

288
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,156
It won't override!

289
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,633
I've sealed you in the engine room, Dave. Afraid me
and the Cat have taken a bit of a nip from the emohawk.

290
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,992
- You what, it's on board?!
- It's taken my bitterness and Cat's cool.

291
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,155
He's in a hell of a shape. He's looking so geeky, I don't think he could even get into a science fiction convention.

292
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,032
- And the emohawk is still on the loose?
- We've got it pinned down in the obs room.

293
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,283
Well, let us in. You need
all the help you can get.

294
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,473
No one I'd rather have
with me in a fracas, Dave

295
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,999
but you're the last human being alive, old love,
and frankly you're just too damn valuable to risk.

296
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,190
Only one way to guarantee victory for the home eleven - I'm gonna open the airlock, suck the little perisher out into deep space.

297
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,030
- Sir, but that would also kill you and the Cat!
- He won't suffer, Kryters.

298
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,158
I'll snap his neck when he's not looking.

299
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,153
Won't feel a thing. Believe me, he'd want it this way.

300
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,354
But sir, if we capture the creature,
we could extract the DNA strands

301
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,194
and re-inject you both,
restore your former personalities.

302
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,752
Too risky, Krytie. Any case, I don't think
I could face becoming... him again.

303
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,517
Everyone has his limits. Fellas, smoke me a kipper,
I'll be back for breakfast.

304
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,270
- What a guy!
- Sir, we've got to save them from themselves.

305
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,796
Their minds are totally distorted.
The Cat's a complete yutz,

306
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,191
and Mr Rimmer's, well... nice.

307
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,876
Charge up the bazookoids.
we'll blast our way in.

308
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,230
Ready, old chum?

309
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,520
Just let me check. Thermos, sandwiches,
corn plasters, telephone money,

310
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,232
dandruff brush, animal footprint chart
and one triple-thick condom.

311
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,996
You never know!

312
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,550
OK, Duane, let's step into the airlock
and get Part 2 of the plan underway.

313
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,112
- Oh, what plan is this?
- Just step in there, Duane.

314
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,197
So, what precisely is the plan, then.

315
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,558
I think you'll find it a little more
comfortable if you stand in front of me.

316
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,797
- Why are we in this airlock?
- Just relax, old chum. I'm sending you on ahead.

317
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,435
- I'm the scout party?
- (EXPLOSION)

318
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,632
Dave, you crazy fool. We're
all set to save your bacon.

319
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,269
There's no need for you to sling your
love spuds on the barbecue.

320
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,438
Sir, we can tackle the emohawk together.

321
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,834
Yeah, one squirt of liquid dilinium will freeze it
exactly where it stands in whatever shape it's in.

322
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,192
OK, fellas... let's go.

323
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,555
Looks like it's lasered its way back to the engine
rooms. Probably looking for you two gents.

324
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,552
Let's go.

325
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,951
According to the psi-scan,
it's somewhere in this location.

326
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,157
It's the barrel!

327
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,834
Sorry. False alarm.

328
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,029
That chain. It's moving!

329
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,032
Sorry! Sorry!

330
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,912
Sir, try and remain calm. You're experiencing a classic
knee-jerk paranoid reaction to a terror situation.

331
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,755
It's essential at this time that we...
IT'S THE WALL!

332
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,112
Shame overload. I-I-I-I... Sorry.

333
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,911
This is impossible. How can we find something
that can disguise itself as anything?

334
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,631
- How can we lure it out?
- Worry ye not, Davey boy. It'll strike soon enough.

335
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,992
Oh. I dropped my thermos.

336
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,998
Er, excuse me? Sirs? Gentlemen?
I think we have a suspect.

337
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
(ROARS)

338
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,074
I got it! I got it!

339
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,199
Oh, it turned into a grenade, but I got it!

340
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,155
- Toss it away, old chum.
- I can't throw. I throw like a geek!

341
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,510
Just chuck it.

342
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,634
- It's gonna blow!
- Leave this to me, Davey boy!

343
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,277
- Smoke me a kipper, I'll be...
- Freeze it, Davey boy!

344
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,671
Sir, how did you know it wouldn't
damage your hard light drive?

345
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,753
Didn't, Kryters.
Just trying to protect you chaps.

346
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,554
Well, sir, better get you back to normal.

347
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,910
Would it be possible for me to stay like this for another 24 hours
before I have to return as that er, (SPITS) ghastly maggot?

348
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,869
It's the least we can do to thank you, sir. And you Cat,
would you like to stay as Duane

349
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,635
Suck my thermos!
I hate being the prince of dorkness.

350
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,633
You never know the next clutzy thing going to...

351
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,518
What a Dibbley!

352
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,191
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

353
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,512
# I'm all alone, more or less

354
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,911
# Let me fly far away from here

355
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
# Fun, fun, fun

356
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,589
# In the sun, sun, sun

357
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,991
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

358
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,312
# Drinking fresh mango juice

359
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,677
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

360
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,480
# Fun, fun, fun

361
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,429
# In the sun, sun, sun

362
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,399
# Fun, fun, fun

363
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,440
# In the sun, sun, sun #
