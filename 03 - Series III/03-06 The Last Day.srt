2
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,772
Breakfast is served, sir.

3
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,973
Oh, boxing. Do you like boxing?

4
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,172
There's nothing wrong with boxing.

5
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:11,016
It's one of the great working-class escapes, boxing.
It's just a sport, like any other.

6
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:13,775
Two highly trained athletes at the peak of physical perfection

7
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,933
trying to outwit each other in a ring of combat.

8
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,251
In fact, at its best it's not a sport, it's an art form.

9
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,657
Female topless boxing?

10
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:25,619
- It's art to me.
- But, they're not even hitting each other.

11
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,331
They just appear to be standing in the
centre of the ring and jiggling up and down.

12
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:34,690
- So, which one are you rooting for, sir?
- I just praying that it goes the distance.

13
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,211
As I was saying, sir. Breakfast is served.

14
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:41,699
Kryten, man, how many times have I told you?
I hate all this master-servant stuff.

15
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:45,491
I'm me own man, you're your own man
and I'll get me own smeggin' breakfast.

16
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,692
Very good, sir.

17
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,138
Goodbye, waffles. Goodbye, maple syrup.

18
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:58,050
Goodbye, fresh cream.
So long, fresh strawberries.

19
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,377
Bon appétit, bin.

21
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,652
(KRYTEN) Oh, Mr David, sir?

22
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,531
A homing pod arrived this morning.
There was just one item.

23
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,967
Divadroid International?

24
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,178
Yes, that's the corporation which
created and supplied me, sir.

25
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:48,660
"To the leaseholder of Kryten 2X4B-523P."

26
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,051
- That's your full name?
- Yes,

27
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,339
but personally I don't much like the 2X4B.

28
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,051
I think it's a jerky middle name. Still, it could be worse.

29
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:03,011
I once knew an android whose middle name
was 2Q4B. Oh, poor sucker!

30
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,291
Greetings. As you are no doubt aware,

31
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:12,894
your Kryten Series III mechanoid is now reaching
the end of its useful service life.

32
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,577
It can hardly have escaped your attention
that he's slow, stupid,

33
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,574
crudely designed and quite amazingly ugly.

34
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,772
He needs replacing.

35
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:26,697
Consequently, his in-built shutdown chip
will automatically activate in 24 hours' time.

36
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,053
Your droid should use this period
to tie up his affairs,

37
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:35,176
dismantle his body and pack himself
neatly away in his original supply case.

38
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,777
Excuse me.

39
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,213
Can't we stop it?
Isn't there something we can do?

40
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:58,534
I'm afraid not, sir. All mechanoids
are supplied with an in-built expiry date.

41
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,137
Well, if we lasted forever, how would
the manufacturers sell the latest models?

42
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,060
(SIGHS) I can't believe it.

43
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:09,419
Oh, don't be distressed, sir. I've lived
a long and relatively interesting life.

44
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,937
The only truly terrible thing is that,
as my adopted owner,

45
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,297
you have to die with me.

46
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,091
- You what?!
- Joke. Deadpan mode.

47
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,020
Aren't you smegged off?
I'd be mad as hell, man!

48
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:30,970
Some git in a white coat designs you to croak just so
he can sell his new android with go-faster stripes.

49
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,617
- To tell the truth, sir, I'm quite sanguine.
- So, what happens?

50
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:38,416
At 0700 hours tomorrow morning,
my shutdown disc will be activated

51
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:42,051
and all mental
and physical operations will cease.

52
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,771
- Then what?
- I don't know, maybe I'll get a job as a disc jockey!

53
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,052
How can you just lie back and accept it?

54
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:51,219
Oh, it's not the end for me, sir. It's just the beginning.

55
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:55,773
I have served my human masters, and now I can
look forward to my reward in Silicon Heaven.

56
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,416
- Silicon what?
- Surely you've heard of Silicon Heaven?

57
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:05,336
Has it got anything to do with being stuck
opposite Brigitte Nielsen in a packed lift?

58
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:08,493
No, no, no. It's the electronic afterlife.

59
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:12,370
It's the gathering place
for the souls of all electrical equipment.

60
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,216
Robots, calculators, toasters,
hairdryers - it's our final resting place.

61
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,733
I don't mean to say anything out of place here, Kryten,
but that's completely Whacko Jacko.

62
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,259
- There is no such thing as Silicon Heaven.
- Then, where do all the calculators go?

63
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:28,579
They don't go anywhere! They just die.

64
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:32,979
Surely you believe that God
is in all things? Aren't you a pantheist?

65
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:37,698
Yeah, but I just don't think it applies to kitchen utensils.
I'm not a frying-pantheist!

66
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:43,254
Machines do not have souls.
Computers and calculators don't have an afterlife.

67
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,937
You don't get hairdryers with tiny little wings,
sitting on clouds, playing harps.

68
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,135
But of course you do!
For is it not written in the Electronic Bible,

69
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,851
"The iron shall lie down with the lamp."

70
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:58,577
It's common sense, sir. If there weren't a better life to look forward to,

71
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,371
why on earth would machines
spend the whole of their lives servicing humankind?

72
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,932
- Now that would be really dumb!
- Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah, Silicon Heaven...

73
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,055
Don't be sad, Mr David, sir.
I am going to a far, far better place.

74
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:14,771
Just out of interest, is Silicon Heaven
the same place as human Heaven?

75
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:19,060
Human Heaven? Goodness me!
Humans don't go to Heaven!

76
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,737
No no, someone just made that up
to prevent you from all going nuts!

77
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,332
Well it's all very sad, Lister, but what can we do?

78
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:40,971
Sad? It's sick! He's been programmed
to believe in an android heaven,

79
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:44,259
so that he doesn't get stroppy
when it comes to turn-off time.

80
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,797
So he accepts a lifetime of
getting the short end of the stick

81
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,414
because he thinks there's gonna be
some big reward at the end.

82
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:53,694
Well at least he gets 24 hours' notice.
That's more than most of us get.

83
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:57,331
All most of us get is,
"Mind that bus!" "What bus?" Splat!

84
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,380
- How's he taking it?
- He just carries on doing his stupid smegging duties.

85
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,335
Maybe I should talk to him.
Maybe he needs a bit of counselling.

86
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:09,770
- You?!
- I used to be in the Samaritans.

87
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,541
- I know. For one morning.
- Well, I couldn't take any more.

88
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:16,974
I don't blame you. You spoke to five
people and they all committed suicide.

89
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,532
I wouldn't mind, but one was a wrong number!

90
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,695
He only phoned up for the cricket scores!

91
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,212
Well, it's hardly my fault that
everyone chose that particular day

92
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,372
to throw themselves off buildings.

93
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,738
Made the papers, you know.
"Lemming Sunday", they called it.

94
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:36,979
Maybe we could find
his shut-off disk and turn it off somehow.

95
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:42,457
He's not a kit droid, Lister. He's not like
that stupid thing Petersen bought on Callisto,

96
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,077
we wouldn't know where to begin!

97
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:46,332
- You're right.
- C'mon, he's happy enough.

98
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,811
You said yourself, he's taking solace in his beliefs.

99
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,052
But his beliefs are a load of baloney!

100
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,063
Everyone's entitled
to their beliefs, Lister.

101
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
I never agreed with my parents' religion
but I wouldn't dream of knocking it.

102
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:01,090
- What were they?
- Seventh-Day Advent Hoppists.

103
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,096
They believed that every Sunday
should be spent hopping.

104
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,299
They would hop to church, hop through
the service then hop back home again.

105
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:13,813
- What was the idea behind that, then?
- Well, you see they took the Bible literally.

106
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:17,019
Adam and Eve, the snake and
the apple. Took it word for word.

107
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,172
Unfortunately, their version had a misprint.

108
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,456
It was all based on 1 Corinthians 13,

109
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:29,572
where it says, "Faith, hop and charity,
and the greatest of these is hop."

110
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,455
So that's what they did every seventh day.

111
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,340
I tell you, Sunday lunchtimes were a nightmare.

112
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,936
Hopping round the table, serving soup...

113
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,820
we all had to wear sou'westers
and asbestos underpants.

114
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,492
Point is, what are we going to do about Kryten?

115
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,341
What can we do?
He's pre-programmed to self-destruct.

116
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,136
At least we can help. At least we can make sure
he goes out with a bang,

117
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,736
give him one last big smegging night to remember.

118
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,496
How do we do that?
He doesn't like doing anything.

119
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:02,178
His idea of a good time is for us all to go
up to the laundry room and fold some sheets!

- I hardly think so.

but I didn't think it mattered since
tomorrow you're gonna be... oh...

Enough of all this chitter-chatter,
let the banquet begin!

159
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,931
- But I don't eat!
- I've knocked up a special mechanoid menu for you.

160
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,815
Oh, there's so much to choose from!

161
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:05,255
Sir, may I recommend the barium
hydrochlorate salad nicoise,

162
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:08,459
followed by the helium-3 isotopes de la maison,

163
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,500
and then perhaps a small radioactive
fruit salad for pudding?

164
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,898
- This is just wonderful!
- Give him the presents!

165
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,651
OK! Keep your fur on!
We've all dug into our bottom drawers.

166
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,614
We wanted to give you something that meant something to us personally.

167
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,051
- Give him mine, give him mine!
- That's from me.

168
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,939
Oh! It's a computer chip!

169
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:33,531
It's a 5517/W-13 alpha-sim modem!

170
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:38,696
It's the interface circuit with a built-in
599XRDP! Oh, how DID you know?

171
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:42,451
- Intuition.
- What about mine? Give him mine!

172
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,096
- Shh!
- This is from me.

173
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:50,051
I picked it up on a trip to Europe. One rival
collector offered me 1,000 dollarpounds for it.

174
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,333
- What is it?
- General George S Patton,

175

commander of the 3rd and 7th Armies,
Allied Invasion Forces,

176
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:01,299
once stopped off at an Italian field hospital
and had his sinuses drained.

177
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:04,897
- This is his sinal fluid?
- Treasure it.

178
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:09,140
- Give him mine! Give him mine!
- This is from him...

179
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,174
- That's from me.
- It's one of your earrings!

180
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:15,578
- That's right!
- The one you really hate!

181
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:19,615
- That's right. I can't stand it!
- Oh! Thank you!

182
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,813
- You're welcome!
- And this is from me.

183

184
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:30,418
Oh! It's a little box that goes "vzzzt!"
That's just what I've always wanted.

(KRYTEN) Goodness me! It's Marilyn Monroe!

186
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,492
- It's a robot kit.
- She's a robot? You're kidding!

187
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,251
She's not quite finished.
It's the best I could do in the time.

188

Enchanté!

189
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:01,091
Like I say, she's not perfect.

190

Don't apologise, it's those cute little
flaws that keep a guy interested.

191

My goodness! I do believe I'm drunk.

192

194

I remember the first time I got drunk.
School trip to Paris.

195
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:36,374
Drank a couple bottles of cheap red plonk and then went on a guided tour of the Eiffel Tower.

196
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:40,336
I was OK till I got the top, then I couldn't keep it in anymore.

197
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:43,732
Apparently, it landed on Montmartre.

198
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,051
That's five miles away!

199

to a Texan tourist,

with this tongue stuck down my throat.

couldn't believe my eyes.

209

It was Uncle Frank.

now you're going through the melancholy stage.

- I never had a mum neither.
- Well, you can all have mine!

217

Everyone else did.

218

- I never had a mum either.
- Oh, for God's sake, what's wrong with everyone?

Why didn't you have a mum?

220
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,617
- I was abandoned.
- Abandoned?

221
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:11,461
Six weeks old. Some cardboard box
underneath a pool table. Just abandoned in this pub.

222
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:15,261
- Oh, how could anybody do that?
- Never found out. Never.

223
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:17,412
Never found out.

224
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,817
Well, I'd have thought it was obvious.

225
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:24,452
Two people, unable to contain
their desires, had an illicit liaison.

226
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:28,455
A liaison that an unforgiving society
would not accept.

227
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:32,216
And you were the fruit
of their forbidden passion.

No no, you don't understand. He won't take no for an answer.

It's the only circumstance under which
an android is programmed to be violent.

- What did the little squashy one say?

He said, "Can I fix you a nice cool drink?"

- There goes your big mouth again.

- Is that the way you want it?
- That's the way it is.

304

Then you'd better leave an address with
your body, so I can mail it to your head.

your big macho chest and your silly oiled nipples.

It doesn't impress me one bit.

I don't know where you've come from
and frankly I don't much care,

312
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:05,616
but if you don't skedaddle pronto,
you're going to see a side of me you won't much like.

313
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,935
What's he gonna do, drop his trousers?

314
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,618
- Lister, I'm handling this.
- (LISTER) Yeah(!)

315
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,411
30 seconds,
Kryten, you're dead.

316
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:17,812
Your way... or mine.

317
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,740
Look, we all know you're programmes not to harm humans,

318
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:24,531
so you can drop all this tough talk,
you big square-jawed chump.

319
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:42,051
You are all viable targets.

320
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:44,059
(GULPS)

321
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,821
Well, it's been a few years since I did that.

322
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:51,412
Ten seconds left. Suck in your last lungful.

323
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,977
- You're a very rude man.
- Dying time!

324
00:23:56,421 --> 00:24:01,697
(SLOW-MOTION) (LISTER) Get out of the way, I can't get a shot in!

325
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:04,061
(SLOW MOTION) (RIMMER) There's nowhere to hide!

326
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:17,330
I'm just doing my job. It's not my fault
if I (COCKS RIFLE) love it.

327
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,333
He's a total nutter!

328
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:25,211
He's been tracking me for thousands
of years! All that time alone, it's worn out his sanity chip!

329
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,820
(GROWLS SONG) # Goodbyee

330
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:28,380
# Goodbyee

331
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:31,977
# Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eyeee #

332
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,491
Look, this is my problem,

333
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,017
- I'll sort it out if it's all the same to you.
- (CAT) Be my guest.

334
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:41,213
Sir, how do you release
the safety catch on this, Mr David?

335
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:44,061
- The one on the back on the side.
- The blue switch?

336
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:48,101
- No, the orange one!
- I don't see it and orange switch. There's a red switch.

337
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:50,975
No, don't touch the red switch, that's the dismantler!

338
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,136
Well, to coin a phrase... Whoops!

339
00:24:57,821 --> 00:24:59,698
Goodbye, old thing.

340
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,978
Lights out, tin can!

341
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:13,134
Hold on, boys. You can't all die at once.

342
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,734
- See you in Silicon Heaven.
- It... It doesn't exist.

343
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:21,576
- What doesn't exist?
- Silicon Heaven. There's no such place.

344
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:26,258
- No such place as Silicon Heaven?
- That's right. The whole thing's a big con.

345
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,771
No such place as Silicon Heaven...

346
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:31,621
- No.
- Then, where do all the calculators go?

347
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,539
They just die. (YELPS)

348
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:39,457
Calculators just die? No such pl..

349
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,295
Need... to... think...

350
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:53,454
A metaphysical dichotomy has forced
this unit to overload and shut down.

351
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,660
Divadroid International would like to apologise
for any inconvenience this may cause.

352
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,811
A credit note will be forwarded
to your company immediately.

353
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,292
What happened?

354
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:09,892
He's an android. His brain couldn't handle the
concept of there being no Silicon Heaven.

355
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:13,053
- So how come yours can?
- I knew something he didn't.

356
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,339
- What?
- I knew I was lying.

357
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:20,620
No Silicon Heaven? Preposterous!
Where would all the calculators go?

358
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,818
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

359
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:30,292
# I'm all alone, more or less

360
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:33,658
# Let me fly far away from here

361
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,495
# Fun, fun, fun

362
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:40,211
# In the sun, sun, sun

363
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,737
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

364
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:47,019
# Drinking fresh mango juice

365
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:50,492
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

366
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:53,221
# Fun, fun, fun

367
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:57,090
# In the sun, sun, sun

368
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,935
# Fun, fun, fun

369
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:04,334
# In the sun, sun, sun #
