00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,519
Look at that collar!
You could go hang-gliding.

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,514
I used to think it was so cool. Come on.

163
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,277
# Om

164
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,271
# Om...

165
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,916
This is one of the first songs I ever wrote.

166
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,030
It was called "Om".

167
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,790
Nothing like a good old-fashioned love song, eh?

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,790
And to think, I genuinely thought we were
gonna be massive. God, I was stupid.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,195
Who are the other two?

170
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:08,278
The whacked out crazy
hippy drummer's called Dobbin.

171
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,272
He joined the police force in the end.
Became a grand wizard in the Freemasons.

172
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,678
The bassist's called Gazza.
He was a neo-Marxist nihilistic anarchist.

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,760
Eventually, he joined a large insurance
company and got his own parking space.

174
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,078
# Om #

175
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,032
Wooh! Yeah!

176
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,840
Rock and roll! Thank you! Thank you very much.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,470
For those who are interested, there are
some official 'Smeg and the Head' T-shirts

178
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,156
and signed Polaroids of the band currently
on sale in the back of Dobbin's car.

179
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,314
It's the orange Ford in the car park. The one
with the bald tyres and no windscreen.

180
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,359
we'll be back in 20 minutes with
our second so from me, Smeg,

181
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,309
and from Dobbin and Gazza, the Heads,
I'll see you later.

182
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,080
I'll catch you guys later.

183
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,914
(KRYTEN) What is this place?
(RIMMER) It's a pub.

184
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,191
"Pub". Ah, yes. A meeting place

185
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,354
where people attempt to achieve
advanced states of mental incompetence

186
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,751
by the repeated consumption
of fermented vegetable drinks.

187
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,431
Guys, guys. I'd like you to meet me, aged 17.

188
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,629
Sha-dy! This is totally shady.
It's beyond shady, it's surreal.

189
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,237
- These your mates, then?
- Yeah. That's Cat, Kryten, and...Rimmer.

190
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,040
Brutal tattoo, man!
What's it stand for? Heavy metal?

191
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,272
- Yes, indeed.
- And him, what's happened to him, his face?!

192
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,671
It's grotesque, isn't it?
Has he had an accident?

193
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,311
He looks like he spent three weeks with his
head jammed in a lift. It's totally shady!

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,636
Just sit down and shut up.

195
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,191
- So, how did you get here and what do you want?
- I've come to try and change our future.

196
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,558
Change it, aren't you happy being a rock star?
are the constant demand of them groupies getting you down?

197
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,799
- We don't make it as a rock star.
- What that's impossible. It cannot be.

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,790
How can I say this without giving offense.
You don't make it 'cause...you're crap.

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,796
Oh, and how would you know, grandad?
You're too old to recieve what we're trying to transmit.

200
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,396
- I'm you, you dork!
- Too old and too crypto-fascist.

201
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,473
Will you shut up and listen? I'm trying to make you rich.

202
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,918
Alls you got to go down to the patent office
and register this as your invention.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,152
- It's called a tension sheet.
- Ah-ah! That's immoral.

204
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,039
- That's Thickie Holden's invention.
- Ah-Ah. Was.

205
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,790
This is just that stuff they used as packing paper
painted red with 'Tension Sheet' painted on it.

206
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,952
- I know.
- It's a piece of crypto-fascist bourgeois crap.

207
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,039
It'll make you a multi-multi-multi-millionaire.

208
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,840
But I'm not into dosh. I hate money, I loathe possessions.

209
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,873
It's just so... so crypto-fascist.

210
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,637
Stop saying everything's crypto-fascist!
You make me sound like I was a complete git!

211
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,039
Look, I'm not breaking up the band. Music is me life.

212
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,076
He's right. You can't make him give up his music.
You heard the "Om" song. It's a masterpiece!

213
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,035
- See?
- Look, back off. I'm trying to give you a break.

214
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,709
Oh, give up. The guy's an idiot.

215
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,639
- He's me!
- Exactly.

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,836
I don't want a break. It's my future. I'll take me own chances, thanks.

217
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,526
If you take your own chances,
you'll wind up stuck on a spaceship

218
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,035
with him, him and him
for the rest of eternity.

219
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,797
You won't have a future.
Ugh. You think about it. C'mon.

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,552
You haven't got a copy of the "Om" song I can take back with me, have you?

221
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,836
- They're all in the car.
- Ah, what a pity.

222
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,431
I just can't get it out of my head. It's so catchy. # Om...

223
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,591
Keep writing those hits, kid.

224
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,753
# Om...

225
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,796
What a nice guy!

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,071
# Om...

227
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,917
- # Om... #
- What now?

228
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,796
Well, it'll take a few seconds for the timelines to
sort themselves out. and then we'll see if it's worked.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,196
It's happening! I'm disappearing!

230
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,473
- What happened?
- Well, Lister altered the timelines

231
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,995
and lived an entirely different life.

232
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,676
Consequently he didn't join Red Dwarf,
consequently the Cat race never existed

233
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,629
and we never rescued Kryten,
so they've disappeared, too.

234
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,474
- So, it's just you and me?
- For the rest of eternity.

235
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,071
No, thanks! Find him and bring him back.

236
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,351
- Anything?
- Got him.

237
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,912
- And?
- Tension sheet. Inventor of: Dave Lister, aged 17.

238
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,637
- Damn!
- And he died tragically in a plane crash, aged 98.

239
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,877
- 98?!
- His own fault, apparently.

240
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,034
He was making love to his 14th wife
and lost control of the plane.

241
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,950
- Have you got any photographs?
- Well, not of that, no...

242
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,754
No, I mean so I can go in and bring him back.

243
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,793
There's only one picture reference,
but you're not going to like it.

244
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,912
- Put it on.
- Now the show that shows the stairway to the stars.

245
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,356
- Heeeeeere's Blaize!
- Hello.

246
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,395
and welcome to the "Lifestyles
of the Disgustingly Rich and Famous."

247
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,077
Tonight, we'll be looking at the world's youngest
billionaire, Mr Dave "Tension Sheet" Lister.

248
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,914
Behind me, Mr Lister's English mansion.

249
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,720
He had the whole building
transported brick by brick

250
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,589
from half a mile down the road,
just to get away from the neighbours.

251
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,469
Now that's the kind of cash
that opens anybody's legs.

252
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,473
The gravel in his drive
came from Buckingham Palace.

253
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,554
Dave bought Buck Palace and had it
ground down just to line his drive.

254
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,432
This man has a wad so thick,
you could use it to beat whales to death.

255
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,389
He calls his home "Xanadu",
not in reference to the famous movie "Citizen Kane",

256
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,680
but as tribute to the hit single
by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich.

257
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
But Dave has musical aspirations of his own.

258
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,871
Only last year, his first single, "Om",
shot to Number One

259
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,192
when he personally purchased
three million copies.

260
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,512
You'll never be short of an ashtray
in his house.

261
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,754
Like many people who appear to have everything,
Dave's life has been tinged with tragedy.

262
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,436
Well, actually, it hasn't, but we can only hope.

263
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,434
Now Dr Bob Porkman, father of the condom
that calls you back...

264
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,671
Freeze. I've seen enough.

265
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,793
- What do you want to do?
- I'm going in.

266
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
- I'm going in to rescue him.
- Rescue him (?)

267
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,994
It's my duty.
My duty as a complete and utter bastard.

268
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,310
# He's got a Swatch watch and a Filofax

269
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,040
# So that he can correlate his facts,
he's got cash

270
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,431
# He's got money

271
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,671
# He's got cash

272
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,037
# He's got money #

273
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,633
Yow!

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,391
Mr Lister, sir. What an utter delight, sir,
it is to welcome you home.

275
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,353
Gilbert, my man! You're looking bad, baby!

276
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,158
- Indeed, sir.
- You're my main, main, main, main man!

277
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,113
I am most awfully sorry about the statue, sir.

278
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,794
The contractors
still haven't devised a way

279
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,793
of making it urinate champagne
into the courtyard,

280
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,079
although I am assured that
it will be fully functional for the royal visit this weekend.

281
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,276
Oh, get outta town! This is gonna slay 'em.

282
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,633
Indeed, sir. I am only just recovering
from the hilarity of the gag myself.

283
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,151
Almost Swiftian in its rapier-like subtlety.

284
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,836
(CLASSICAL MUSIC: VIVALDI)

285
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,069
I told Daddy today. About us, I mean.

286
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,353
- How did the old codger take it?
- Well, not terribly well, actually.

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,276
He perched himself on top of his clay pigeon
launching machine and shouted, "Pull!"

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,037
For madam, Lobster a la Grecque.

289
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,671
For sir, a sausage and onion gravy
sandwich on white bread

290
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,719
with a glass of sterilised milk.

291
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,191
This is brilliant. We used to llive on these
when I was in the band.

292
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,480
As requested, sir, it was helicoptered in this
morning from Luigi's Fish 'n' Chip Emporium.

293
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,399
An artist beyond comparison, sir.

294
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,389
Excuse me, sir, but a gentleman appears
to have appeared in the corner of the room.

295
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,598
Listy, it's me. It's me, Rimmer.

296
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,037
Rimmsy. Arnie Rimmer. Arnie.
Old Iron Balls. Rimmer. Rimmer!

297
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,959
Apparently, the gentleman's name is Rimmer, sir.

298
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,279
- Have we met?
- Have we met? We're like brothers.

299
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,829
We were shipmates. Red Dwarf.

300
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,789
- You don't remember, do you?
- Remember what?

301
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,713
Of course you don't remember. It hasn't happened, has it?

302
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,510
- What hasn't happened?
- Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones!

303
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,876
- Yes?
- THE Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones?

304
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,277
Model, best-selling novelist
and international jet-setter?

305
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,431
Yeah. She's me bird.

306
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,591
"She's me bird."

307
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,310
You talk about the Duke of Lincoln's
eldest daughter as "me bird"?

308
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,273
Gilbert, can you escort Mr Rumour to the door?

309
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,035
- But I've come here to save you.
- Throw him out, Gilbert. He's a nutter.

310
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,636
- If you care to step this way, sir.
- But we were friends, buddies!

311
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,189
Let's not have a scene, sir.

312
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,275
You call this happiness? Surrounded
by toadying lackeys and paid sycophants?

313
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,274
Living with a love goddess sex-bomb model mega-star, you call this contentment?

314
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,680
You know, I stand here now and look at the two of us
and I ask one simple question...

315
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,470
Who is the rich man? You, with your 58 houses,

316
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,836
your private island in the Bahamas,

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,276
your multi-billion-pound business empire,

318
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,753
or me with... with...with what I've got.

319
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,515
It's you, isn't it?

320
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,150
Yes, it's all clear to me now.
You...richer and happier.

321
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,751
This way, sir.

322
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,355
I should have thought a bit harder about that
speech, really. I cocked it up a bit, didn't I?

323
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,638
- (HOLLY) Any luck?
- Useless.

324
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,916
Didn't listen. Didn't even recognise me.

325
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,959
He just thought I was some
neurotic, deranged, crazy madman.

326
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,197
You sure he didn't recognise you?

327
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,349
Wait a tension-popping minute.
If Lister can do it, why can't I?

328
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,396
These photographs, there's one somewhere
here of me at boarding school, aged eight.

329
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,757
I can invent the tension sheet
before him. I can get there first!

330
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,600
But then you'll disappear
and become incredibly wealthy,

331
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,956
and Lister will be sent hurtling back through time.

332
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,671
Yes, and Cat and Kryten
will be brought back into existence.

333
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,156
True, as a by-product, I'll become mega-rich

334
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,109
and be forced to have constant sex
with that Jjones woman,

335
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,794
but that's a sacrifice I'm prepared to make.

336
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,311
Holly, torch.

337
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,153
- Pssst! Wake up.
- What is it?

338
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,552
- Who are you?
- Look, don't be afraid.

339
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,950
I'm going to make you rich.

340
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,715
All you've got to do
is listen very, very carefully.

341
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,637
Right, this is the plan. You are going to
invent a thing called the tension sheet.

342
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,076
- Pension sheet?
- T.T. Tension.

343
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,311
Tension sheet. Will you shut up. I'm trying to talk to the kid.

344
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,514
Are you listening? They're little sheets
of paper with lots of air bubbles in them.

345
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,953
Like you get in packing paper?

346
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:54,390
Look, do you mind, Holden? This is a
private conversation. Go back to sleep.

347
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,196
They're exactly the same as the ones you get
in packing paper, but you paint them red.

348
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,749
- Why red?
- Because it helps people relax.

349
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,395
Look, will you shut up? I'm trying to make the kid rich.

350
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,397
You'd write better if you
took off your boxing gloves.

351
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,429
- Now, have you got all that?
- I think so.

352
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,513
First thing tomorrow,
take the idea to the patent office.

353
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,914
I can't. Not first thing in the morning. I've got extra
rugby practice because I'm so wet.

354
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,239
All right, lunchtime.
Take it at lunchtime, OK?

355
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,191
I've got to go now.

356
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,318
Oi. Don't mess this up.

357
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,511
No, sir.

358
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,956
# Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
# If I were a rich man

359
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,112
# Dubba dubba dubba dubba dubba dubba dubba dum... #

360
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,511
- Worked, did it?
- Holly though it pains me dearly,

361
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,230
I'll be having to say ta-ta. Ta-ta to your stupid gormless face.

362
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,000
Ta-ta, poverty. Ta-ta, failure.

363
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,710
Hello, Sabrina. Hello, sexual ecstasy.

364
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,710
A-ha. Here they come, bang on time.

365
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,272
Well, gentlemen, just enough time
for me to say toodly-pipski.

366
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,671
- I'll be disappearing any moment now.
- What happened?

367
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,638
Here it comes... Any moment.

368
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,436
What's he talking about?

369
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,638
Any moment... Any moment now.

370
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,393
It hasn't worked. According to my databank,
you didn't invent the tension sheet.

371
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,552
It was invented by a gentleman
named "Thickie" Holden.

372
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,196
What?

373
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,751
All you've gone and done is put
things back exactly as they were.

374
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,995
Why does nothing ever go right for me?

375
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,630
Every time I get so much
as a snifter of a break,

376
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,351
a glimpse of a shadow of happiness, something
inexplicably cruel and horrible happens,

377
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,558
and it all blows up in my face.
- Hang on a mo...

378
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,918
Something is different. Don't ask me why,
but somehow you're no longer a hologram.

379
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,674
- You're alive.
- What?

380
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,351
I'm alive!

381
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,353
I'm alive!

382
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,397
Mmmm!

383
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,551
I'm alive!

384
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,030
Kryten, unpack Rachel
and get out the puncture repair kit.

385
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,589
I'm alive!

386
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,394
I'm alive. I can touch, I can feel, I can fondle.

387
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,712
I'm alive! Don't you think
it's incredible? I am ali...

388
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,071
What was he saying?

389
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,272
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

390
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,751
# I'm all alone, more or less

391
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,117
# Let me fly far away from here

392
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,954
# Fun, fun, fun

393
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,670
# In the sun, sun, sun

394
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,196
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

395
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,478
# Drinking fresh mango juice

396
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,951
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

397
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,680
# Fun, fun, fun

398
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,549
# In the sun, sun, sun

399
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,394
# Fun, fun, fun

400
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,793
# In the sun, sun, sun #
