Maybe they left us a clue or something.

173
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,272
Ah, man they must have left them
to tell us where they'll be.

174
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,593
- What's it say?
- Dunno, it's in some weird language.

175
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,192
"Srehtorb." That must be Polish
or Bulgarian or somethin'.

- Bulgarian, me?! I can hardly speak English.

- It's in Bulgaria isn't it?
- Are you sure?

180
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,520
Absolutely, Geography was my number-one subject
at school.

181
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,719
Nodnol, Bulgaria - rich in animal produce
and mineral wealth, just south of Bosnia.

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,515
- What's "selim"?
- Well, obviously, Bulgarian for kilometres.

- We've got used to it.

you have a funeral, then come back to life.

- That's a good thing?
- Millions of people will come to life.

280

Hitler will retreat across Europe,
liberate France and Poland,

- We don't want any trouble.

320
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,032
No, no, you don't understand.
All this mess, all this debris,

321
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,273
is from the fight we got fired for,
this is from a fight we're about to have!

322
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,757
ABOUT to have?
I don't wanna be involved in a bar room brawl.

323
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,079
It's not a bar room brawl.
It's a bar room tidy. Unrumble!

324
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,955
- Where are you going, you coward.
- I've just worked out what happens to me back.

325
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,554
Here, matey, have your tooth back.

326
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,936
(BACKWARDS CHATTER)

328
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,198
Good one, gentlemen.
Thanks for your support. Let's go.

329
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,431
I've forgotten something.

330
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,113
- (SPEAKS BACKWARDS)
- What the hell? It's a good cause.

331
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,909
How much is that, matey?

332
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,673
Oh, aye, yeah!

333
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,433
(CABBIE) Oi!

334
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,557
Tight git.

335
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,595
You know, it could have worked.
It really could. Where's the Cat?

336
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,072
He won't be long.
He's...you know...in the bushes.

337
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,910
We've got to stop him.

338
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,551
Don't ask!

339
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,518
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

340
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,991
# I'm all alone, more or less

341
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,357
# Let me fly far away from here

342
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,194
# Fun, fun, fun

343
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,910
# In the sun, sun, sun

344
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,436
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

345
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,718
# Drinking fresh mango juice

346
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,191
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

347
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,920
# Fun, fun, fun

348
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,789
# In the sun, sun, sun

349
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,634
# Fun, fun, fun

350
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,033
# In the sun, sun, sun #
