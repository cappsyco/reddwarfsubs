- Where have you been? Didn't you get the message?
- What message?

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,754
One of the Skutters has
gone bananas,

10
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,058
he's completely rewired the maintenance
decks back to front and upside down

11

We've got over 2,000 wiring faults.
Don't breathe. Don't touch anything.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,038
- The whole ship's a gigantic booby trap.
- No poker, then?

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,990
We can't find the auto-destruct system. It's wired up
to something, but we don't know what. Tell the Cat.

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,513
It's taken me ages to mark these cards.

- Nothing electrical. Not until we get the all-clear.

How do we switch it off?

31
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,112
The only person who can override
the auto-destruct is the Captain.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,357
- Dead.
- Or one of the senior officers.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,597
- Dead.
- I suppose in many ways,

Is there any way that we can trick the machine
into thinking that one of us is the Captain?

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,476
No. Checks his voiceprint and brain scan against its databank.

- Self-destruct in eight minutes and counting.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,710
- Well?
- I've been through the whole of my database, collated every single option,

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,951
and there are three realistic alternatives:

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,589
One - sit here and get blown up.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,872
Two - stand here and get blown up.

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,039
Three - jump up and down, shout at me for not being
able to think of anything, then get blown up.

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,791
- There must be something?
- Perhaps we could try a mind-swap?

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,712
It's something we tried once on the Nova 5.

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,191
It uses exactly the same science
as generating a hologram.

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,149
We wipe all your brain patterns
and put them on a storage disk.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,032
Then we transfer the Captain's mind from
his hologram personality disk into your empty brain.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,716
- You tried this on Nova 5?
- Oh, yes.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,354
- Did it work?
- No, but I'm pretty sure I know what went wrong.

Two minutes to self-destruct and counting.

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,394
- So, The Captain's mind will be in my body?
- Yes. Then, hopefully,

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,876
the self-destruct mechanism will think you're
the Captain, and you can activate the override.

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,509
- But where will my mind be?
- On this.

about Brown? Brown was Executive Officer.

- A mind enema...

61

- So we can flush out your brain.
- Nobody's flushin' out my brain.

- We'll transfer it back afterwards.

This is getting stupid. Back off, let him go.

313
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,315
- We're almost on him.
- (LISTER) It's too dangerous. Let him go.

314
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,118
(LAUGHS) Chickens!

315
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,273
Oh, smeg!

316
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,479
What the smeggin' smeg's
he smeggin' done? He's smeggin' killed me!

317
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,109
- Whoops!
- Are you all right?

318
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,159
- You're going to go spare.
- What? What is it?

319
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,000
You're going to go absolutely spare.

320
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,319
- Me arm! You've lost me arm!
- I've lost your watch too.

321
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,678
- You bastard!
- No, you're right. It's my fault.

322
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,759
My hands are up... Well, my hand is up!

323
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,791
You think it's funny?

324
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,997
No. But this is!

325
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,156
Oh, hello. It's Captain Chloroform.

326
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,156
Please, Mr David, sir.

327
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,951
My quilt chip is already in overdrive.
I - I feel terrible! Oh!

328
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,274
You feel terrible? What about my smegging head?

329
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,352
I had to obey him. It's in my programming
to obey all humans, no matter how insane.

330
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,991
Dinner is served, sir.

331
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,194
A lettuce leaf and grated carrot.
I'm on this for six months.

332
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,040
What's wrong with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

333
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,675
(CAT'S VOICE) I was asleep, OK?

334
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,471
And then next thing I know. Plastic Percy here
puts a sponge on my face and out go the lights.

335
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,432
It was an order!

336
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,874
(RIMMER'S VOICE) Just one night, I promise.

337
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,671
I'll give it back first thing tomorrow.
Maybe Thursday.

338
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,914
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

339
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,391
# I'm all alone, more or less

340
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,757
# Let me fly far away from here

341
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,594
# Fun, fun, fun

342
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,310
# In the sun, sun, sun

343
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,836
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

344
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,118
# Drinking fresh mango juice

345
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,591
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

346
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,320
# Fun, fun, fun

347
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,189
# In the sun, sun, sun

348
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,034
# Fun, fun, fun

349
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,433
# In the sun, sun, sun #
