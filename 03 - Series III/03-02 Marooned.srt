00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,311
(RED DWARF THEME)

2
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,572
(HOLLY) Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
Black hole approaching.

3
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,971
This is not a drill. THIS is a drill...

4
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,540
(DRILLING)

5
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,375
Abandon ship!
Oh, God! Now the siren's bust.

6
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,300
Awooga! Awooga! Abandon ship!

7
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,762
But a black hole is a huge, impacted star.
It's millions of miles wide.

8
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,415
It's massive! Why didn't you
see anything on the radar screen?

9
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,897
Well, the thing about a black hole,

10
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:09,940
its main distinguishing feature, is it's black!

11
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,854
And the thing about space, the colour of space,

12
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,093
your basic space colour...is it's black!

13
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,891
- How are you supposed to see them?
- But five of them...

14
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,770
How can you be ambushed by five black holes?

15
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,172
It's always the way, innit?

16
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,413
We've been in deep space for three
million years and there hasn't been one.

17
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:32,334
Then all of a sudden, five turn up at once!

18
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,257
Come on. We've only got 20 minutes.

19
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,725
Careful, careful! Mind
the hatchway, don't knock it.

20
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,052
What did you want to
bring this piece of junk for?

21
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:43,612
That "piece of junk" happens
to be a Javanese camphor-wood chest.

22
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:46,455
It belonged to my father and
it's got all my valuables in it.

23
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:51,497
I never knew you had so much
crap! What's this? Toy soldiers?

24
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:55,179
"Toy soldiers"?
They've been in our family for years.

25
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:59,050
They're priceless 19th Century replicas
of Napoleon's Armée du Nord.

26
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,891
So you can't change the clothes
and that like you can with Sindy?

27
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:08,175
- Look, we've got barely 15 minutes.
- What the smeg is this?!

28
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,725
Just what little I've managed
to scrimp and scrape

29
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:13,012
by tossing the odd copper
aside for a rainy day.

30
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,520
Rimmer, there must
be 20 grand here...

31
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:16,976
24. Look, I thought we were
supposed to be getting off the ship?

32
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:21,732
24,000!... And you had the
front to borrow money off me

33
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,814
to buy ME a birthday present!

34
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,738
That's going back a bit, Lister. It was only 15 quid.

35
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:34,658
Right yeah, 15 quid. And what did I get?
A five-quid book token.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,257
Those cards aren't free, you know. I had to fork out for that as well.

37
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,697
Rimmer, you never even paid me back.

38
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,853
Honestly, you're tighter than an Italian waiter's keks.

39
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,772
Blue Midget is loaded.

40
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,410
- Aren't you guys ready yet?
- Don't hang around for us, we'll catch you up.

41
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,051
- Are you sure you've got everything?
- Just the bare essentials: food and medical supplies.

42
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,094
Yeah, I'm just taking the bare essentials, too - 36 changes of clothing

43
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,252
and ten full-length dress mirrors.

44
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,654
Cat, we're going to be away for 12 hours.

45
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:07,495
- You think I need more mirrors?
- Let's get out of here. Let's go, go, go!

46
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:16,180
- Right, I want a safe, sensible drive. No stunts.
- No worries.

47
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:24,396
(HOLLY) OK, this is
the plan...

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,540
I'll navigate Red Dwarf through the
minefield of black holes.

49
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:29,739
If all goes well,
we'll rendezvous on the desert moon Sigma-14D.

50
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,017
(LISTER) But what happens if all *doesn't* go well?

51
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:36,015
(HOLLY) Well, Red Dwarf and everything in it will be
compacted down to the size of a garden pea.

52
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,452
(LISTER) Bye-bye, Birdseye.

53
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,654
- Please, honestly, they're priceless!
- I'm only having a goosie.

54
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,813
Look, If you get curry all over
them, how's that going to look?

55
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,611
What's Lt. Gen. Baron Jaquinaux
of the First Cavalry Division supposed to be doing

56
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,375
with meat vindaloo all over his tunic?

57
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:02,058
It'll make him look more authentic.
People'll think he's got dysentery.

58
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,376
You're obsessed with war though, aren't you?

59
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,294
I mean you collect toy soldiers. You play war games.

60
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,896
You read those stupid combat magazines.

61
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:15,532
And half your books are about Patton
and Caesar and various other gits.

62
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,931
It's about leadership. That's what I admire.

63
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:22,374
It's just so ironic really when, deep down,
you're such a basic natural coward.

64
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:26,498
- Coward?!
- Planet leave. Miranda.

65
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:28,652
That space bar "The Hacienda"? Remember that?

66
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,017
When that fight started up
Rimmer, you were out of that door

67
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,378
quicker than a whippet with a bumful of dynamite.

68
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,619
That was a bar room brawl,
that was a common pub fight,

69
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,818
a shambolic drunken set-to.

70
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,895
Which you started.

71
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,491
I just made an innocuous comment.

72
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,653
I merely voiced the rumour
that MacWilliams was sexually tilted

73
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,495
in favour of sleeping with the dead.

74
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,221
I didn't start the rumour. I merely voiced it.

75
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,379
To his face. Right to his face.

76
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,454
When he was with his four biggest mates.

77
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:04,091
Then you do a Roadrunner act
and you leave me to face the music.

78
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,302
Well, I could've got hurt!

79
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,692
(SCOFFS) You'd've made a
brilliant general, wouldn't you?

80
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:11,656
Lister, Generals don't smash chairs
over people's heads.

81
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:14,415
They don't get Newcastle Brown
bottles, stick them in your face

82
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,494
and say, "Stitch that, Jimmy."

83
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:22,292
Generals are in the nice white tent on the hill,
sipping Sancerre, directing the battle.

84
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:26,136
- They're men of honour.
- I don't believe it. You make war sound romantic.

85
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:30,050
I'll tell you something,
something I've never told anyone.

86
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:35,694
When I was 15, I went on a school trip to Macedonia
to the site of Alexander the Great's palace.

87
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,412
And for the first time
in my whole life, I felt... I felt I was home.

88
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,095
This palace was where I belonged.

89
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:47,812
Years later, I got friendly
with a hypnotherapist, Donald.

90
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:53,255
I told him about the Alexander The Great thing, and he said
he could regress me back through my past lives.

91
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,975
I was dubious, but I let him put me back.

92
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,215
It turned out my instincts were absolutely correct.

93
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:03,773
I had lived a past life in Macedonia.
That palace WAS my home.

94
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,979
Because, you see Lister, believe it or not,

95
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:10,611
he told me that in a previous incarnation,

96
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:14,979
I was Alexander the Great's chief eunuch.

97
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,819
Do you know something? I believe you.

98
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,095
He didn't say
I was Alexander the Great himself,

99
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,970
which is obviously what I wanted to hear,
but it explained everything.

100
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:31,213
I'd lived a past life alongside
one of the greatest generals in history.

101
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:35,295
- No wonder the military is in my blood.
- No wonder you're such a good singer.

102
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:39,237
Well, maybe it's tot, I don't
know. But it's funny, even to this day,

103
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,497
I can't look at a pair of
nutcrackers without wincing.

104
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,294
And why is it every time I'm
with a large group of women,

105
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:50,898
I have this overwhelming urge
to bathe them in warm olive oil.

106
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:55,140
Rimmer, I have that urge.
It's got nothing to do with past lives.

107
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:00,450
- Well, why is it, then?
- It's because you're unhappy.

108
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:05,218
You're unhappy with your own boring,
humdrum, weaselly existence.

109
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:11,372
You're looking for something
with a bit more - oh, I don't know - glamour.

110
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,930
Now is what counts, Rimmer, living for today.

111
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,804
I mean, Who knows what's
gonna happen tomorrow?

112
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,758
Who knows what's gonna
happen in the next five minutes?

113
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,091
That's what makes life so exciting.

114
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:00,913
Arrrgh!!

115
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:01,937
Oof!!

116
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,495
(SQUEALS)

117
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:26,058
Mayday. Mayday. Can you read me?
Come in, please. Can you read me?

118
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,177
Still snowing, is it?

119
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,976
It's useless. You can hardly stand up,
never mind dig it out.

120
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,650
- No luck?
- Nothing's getting through.

121
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:44,140
Three smegging days. They must be looking for us
by now. Where the smeg are they?

122
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:48,699
It's impossible to find us in this weather,
they could be ten feet away and walk straight past us.

123
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,337
We're going to die, aren't we?
How much food is there?

124
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,977
There's half a bag
of soggy smoky bacon crisps,

125
00:08:56,141 --> 00:09:00,897
a tin of mustard powder, three water biscuits,

126
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:03,530
a brown lemon, two bottles of vinegar

127
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:07,296
and a tube of Bonjela gum ointment.

128
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:11,574
- Gum ointment?
- I found it in the first-aid box.

129
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,017
It's that minty flavour. It's quite nice.

130
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:17,334
It's quite nice if you smear it on your mouth ulcer, Rimmer.

131
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,732
- You can't sit down and eat it.
- You may have to.

132
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:25,139
- That's it? There's nothing else?
- Just a Pot Noodle...

133
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,815
Oh, and I found a tin of
dog food in the tool cupboard.

134
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:30,376
Well, it's obvious what gets eaten last, then isn't it?

135
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,851
I can't stand Pot Noodles.

136
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,332
We're going to die, aren't we?
Correction: I'M going to die.

137
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,215
I mean, you're a hologram. You're already dead. You don't need food.

138
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,294
- Did you find any wood?
- There's no wood out there.

139
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,499
There's no vegetation.
Smeg all. Just a wasteland.

140
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:49,614
You've got to keep this fire going. 
It's your only form of heat

141
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,256
I'm going to die, aren't I?

142
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:54,412
God, I'm hungry. I'm gonna have crisps.

143
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:55,980
- No!
- Just one.

144
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,536
You ate less than 16 hours ago.

145
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,974
I had a raw sprout and that piece of chewing gum
I found stuck under the desk!

146
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,378
Look, you've got to pace yourself.
Go to sleep. Wait till tomorrow.

147
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,893
It's OK for you, you're a hologram. You don't
need to eat. You don't even feel the cold.

148
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,571
Look, think of something else.
Try to take your mind off it.

149
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,892
Mayday. Mayday.

150
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,816
- I wonder they call it "Mayday"?
- Eh?

151
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:25,770
The distress call. I wonder why it's "Mayday"?
It's only a bank holiday.

152
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,059
Why not Shrove Tuesday
or Ascension Sunday?

153
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,651
Ascension Sunday. Ascension Sunday.

154
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:38,736
The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost.
The 15th Wednesday after Pentecost.

155
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:43,780
It's French, you doink. "M'aidez." "Help me."

156
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,501
- M-aid-ez.
- Is that right?

157
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,971
Everywhere I look reminds me of food.

158
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:51,291
Look at these books - Charles Lamb...

159
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,372
Herman Wok...

160
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,934
The Complete Works of Sir Francis Bacon...

161
00:10:58,101 --> 00:10:59,899
Eric Van Lustbader...

162
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:03,778
Eric Van Lustbader?
What's he got to do with food?

163
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:07,611
Van. Meat van. Bread van. Food!

164
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:10,337
Look, you're getting obsessed.

165
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,220
It's just these books.
It's like someone put them here to taunt me.

166
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,941
Look at this one,
"The Caretaker" by Harold Pint-er.

167
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,892
It's Pinter.

168
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:22,213
- Look, stop thinking about food.
- Take my mind off it.

169
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,418
- Talk to me about something.
- Like what?

170
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:27,295
- Anything.
- Erm...

171
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:30,135
- Anything apart from food?
- Don't talk about food.

172
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:35,734
- I just can't think of another topic.
- Don't mention Topics. They're food!

173
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:39,371
- Tell me a story, man. Any story.
- I don't know any stories.

174
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:43,775
- Anything. Tell me how you lost your virginity.
- My what?

175
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:47,696
- Talk to me.
- How I lost it?

176
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,052
Well, it was so long ago, Lister.

177
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,976
I was so young and sexually precocious,
I'm not sure I can remember.

178
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,811
Rimmer, everyone can remember how they lost their virginity.
It's just one of those things.

179
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:02,736
Like everyone can remember where they were
the day Cliff Richard was shot...

180
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,410
or when the first woman landed on Pluto,

181
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,267
or when they installed
that gigantic toupee over

182
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,976
the Earth to cover the
gap in the ozone layer.

183
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,860
It's just one of those things you always remember.

184
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:21,980
Well, I don't. Good grief! You can hardly expect me
to recall every single sexual liaison I'd ever partaken of.

185
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,135
- What do you think I am, the Memory Man?
- Rimmer, dont' give me this, I want the truth.

186
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,177
- The truth?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,818
There's not much to tell, really.

188
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,894
I was always a bit of a fish out of water around women.

189
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:39,179
Never know what to say to them.

190
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:43,254
I never think I was very highly sexed, to be honest with you.

191
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,892
I think it was all that school cabbage
I was forced to eat as a boy.

192
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:50,132
Still, the first ever time...

193
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:54,659
The first time was this girl
I met at cadet school called Sandra.

194
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,937
We did it in the back of my brother's car.

195
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:00,611
- What was it like?
- Brilliant. Incredible.

196
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,772
Bentley V8 convertible.

197
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:08,290
Walnut burr panelling.
Marvellous machine. Marvellous.

198
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,974
- So, come on, how did you lose yours?
- Michelle Fisher.

199
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,815
The ninth hole
of the Bootle municipal golf course.

200
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,099
Par four, dog-leg to the right,
in the bunker behind the green.

201
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:24,579
You lost your virginity on a golf course?
How did you have the nerve?

202
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:28,979
It wasn't in the middle of the Ryder Cup
or anything. It was midnight.

203
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,493
How old were you?

204
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:34,662
She was so good-looking if she
wanted, she could've got a job working

205
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,831
behind the perfume counter at
Lewis's. That's how gorgeous she was.

206
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,227
How old were you?

207
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,533
She just took all her clothes off and stood
there in front of me completely naked.

208
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:46,137
I was so excited,
I nearly dropped me skateboard.

209
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:49,460
- Skateboard?! How old were you?
- Twelve.

210
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,694
Twelve?!

211
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,167
- Twelve years old?!
- Yeah.

212
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,451
You lost your virginity when you were twelve?!

213
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,292
Twelve?!

214
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:06,570
You can't have been a full member
of the golf club, then.

215
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,492
Of course I wasn't!

216
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:13,571
You did it on a golf course
and you weren't a member?!

217
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:14,856
Of course I wasn't.

218
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:18,577
You didn't pay any
green fees or anything?!

219
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,211
It was just a place to go.

220
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:26,893
I used to play golf.
I hate people who abuse the facilities.

221
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:30,973
I hope you raked the sand back
nicely before you left.

222
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,417
That'd be a hell of a lie to get into, wouldn't it?

223
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,815
Competition the next day, your ball lands
in Lister's buttock crevice.

224
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,780
You'd need more than a
niblick to get that one out.

225
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,099
- Are you trying to say I've got a big bum?
- Big?

226
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,696
It's like two badly parked Volkswagens.

227
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:53,573
The only thing I ever
lost when I was twelve,

228
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:57,577
were my shoes with the compass in the
heel and the animal-tracks in the soles.

229
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,496
Porky Roebuck threw them in the septic tank
behind the sports ground.

230
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,652
I cried for weeks.

231
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,017
I was wearing them.

232
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,815
I never even thought about sex when I was 12.

233
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:14,936
Maybe that's because you use to be
Alexander the Great's chief eunuch.

234
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,935
- What are you doing?!
- There's nothing left to burn.

235
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,213
- But my books! Don't burn my books!
- There's nothing else left.

236
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,499
But it's obscene. A book is a thing of beauty.

237
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:27,175
It's the voice of freedom, the essence of civilisation.

238
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,816
"Biggles Learns to Fly"?

239
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,416
Well, perhaps not that one,
but you know what I'm saying.

240
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,976
"The Complete Works of Shakespeare."

241
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,337
This'll be good for a couple of hours.

242
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:42,176
I dont know, three days without food, and the
walls of civilisation comes tumbling down.

243
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,372
What are you on about?

244
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,216
They say that any society
is three meals away from revolution.

245
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,170
Deprive a culture of food for three meals
and you'll have anarchy.

246
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:56,574
It's true, isn't it? You've gone without food
for two days and you're turning into a barbarian.

247
00:15:56,741 --> 00:16:00,132
- I'm just burning a book.
- But, it's not just a book.

248
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,373
It's the only copy of probably the greatest
work in English literature.

249
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,817
Probably the only copy left in the entire universe,

250
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:09,656
and you're quite happy to chuck it on the fire
to keep your mitts warm for 15 minutes.

251
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,051
There's nothing left to burn!

252
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,861
That's it, then, is it? Toodle-pip, King Lear.

253
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,695
Farewell, Macbeth. Bye-bye, Hamlet.

254
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:21,135
Have you ever actually read any of it?

255
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:25,419
I've seen... "West Side Story". That's based on one of them.

256
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:30,131
Have you ever actually *read* any of it?

257
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,292
Not all the way through, no.

258
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,532
- But I can quote some, though.
- Well, go on, then.

259
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,539
"Now..."

260
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:47,251
That's all I can remember.

261
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:51,741
- What's that from, then?
- "Richard Ill", you moron.

262
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,883
The brilliant "now" speech
he does at the beginning.

263
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:55,576
"Now... something,
something, something..."

264
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,051
It's brilliant. Unforgettable.

265
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:03,301
I'll save it until last. "Lolita", is it OK if I burn "Lolita"?

266
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,697
Save page 61.

267
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,853
- That bit.
- That's disgusting...

268
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,540
And, you can take that look off your
face, like I'm doing something disgusting.

269
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:45,171
- I'm just trying to stay alive.
- You're going to eat the dog food?

270
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:50,176
Yeah! Yeah, I haven't eaten for six days.
I'm going to eat the dog food.

271
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,941
I'm sure the dog food'll be lovely.

272
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:59,701
Rimmer, this isn't dog food. It's a piece
of prime fillet steak in blue cheese sauce.

273
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:04,253
It's been charcoal-broiled in garlic butter
and is going to taste delicious.

274
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:07,061
Delicious... Delicious...

275
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:18,335
Well, now I can see why
dogs lick their testicles.

276
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,214
It's to take away the taste of the food.

277
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:31,013
The stove's getting low.
Better throw another book on.

278
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,895
- That's the last one.
- You've burnt all of them?

279
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:38,413
When we get through to Act Five
of "Henry VIII", I'm a dead man.

280
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,340
There must be something else to burn.

281
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,940
No. Not the trunk. It's Javanese
camphor wood. It's priceless.

282
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:53,815
There's nothing else to burn except the trunk and what's in the trunk.

283
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:57,377
Now, wait a minute! Not Napoleon's Armée du Nord.

284
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,737
Rimmer, get real, man. What's important?

285
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:03,738
If it burns, we burn it. What's the least valuable?

286
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,972
Not the trunk. My father gave me that trunk.

287
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,616
- The soldiers, then.
- But, they're 19th-century.

288
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,137
They're irreplaceable. They were hand-carved
by the legendary Dubois brothers.

289
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,412
Well, then?

290
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,492
Better start unpacking the soldiers.

291
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,450
No. There must be something else
to burn. There must be.

292
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:29,092
Rimmer, there isn't. I've looked.
Look, I know it must be a bit of a bummer.

293
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:32,379
I know it must be heartbreaking,
but it's just stuff.

294
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,454
It's only possessions. They're only- they're only things.

295
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,771
In the end, they're not important.

296
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:41,297
I mean, they might go for a bundle
in some swanky Islington antique shop,

297
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:45,978
but right here and now,
all they are is nicely painted firewood.

298
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,935
This isn't happening. It's a nightmare.

299
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:52,497
I mean, you've got to get your priorities right.

300
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:55,892
It's like people you read about
who run back into a burning house

301
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,816
to rescue some treasured piece of furniture
and wind up burning to death.

302
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,537
I mean, nothing's more important than a human life...

303
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,739
-What about your guitar?
- ...except my guitar.

304
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:09,172
Why didn't we think of it before?
We can burn your guitar!

305
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,941
- Not my guitar, Rimmer.
- It's made of wood.

306
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,577
Yeah, but it's my guitar.
I've had it since I was 16.

307
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,937
That is an authentic Les Paul copy.

308
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,259
It's not worth anything.
It's just a thing, just a possession.

309
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:25,341
- Yeah, but it's mine!
- How is it any different from MY soldiers?

310
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,932
That's my lifeline. I need that guitar.

311
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:34,417
I mean, when it gets to me...
I mean, the loneliness and all that...

312
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:38,734
When it gets on top of me,
it's my only means of escape.

313
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,780
I mean, I know I'm not exactly a wizard on it.

314
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,855
I know it's only got five strings
and three of them are G...

315
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:49,457
but through the whole of my life, I've never had anything to cling onto

316
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,010
no roots, no parents, no education...

317
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:55,293
- No education?
- I went to art college.

318
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,131
All I've ever had is that guitar.

319
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:02,295
It's the only thing through the whole of my
miserable smegging life that hasn't walked out on me.

320
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,452
Don't make me burn it.

321
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:09,612
We've got to.

322
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,014
Look, I know
this might sound stupid, like, but...

323
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:23,493
can I just play one song on it,
just one for the road?

324
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,897
Sure, sure.
I mean, I'm not enjoying this.

325
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:28,655
I know, man. Thanks.

326
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,294
# She's out of my life

327
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:43,579
(OFF-KEY) # I don't know
whether to laugh or cry... #

328
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,771
My step-dad taught me this one.

329
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,615
It's the first song I ever learned to play.

330
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:54,260
- I'm just going to, er...
- # I don't know whether to live or die

331
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:56,981
# She's out of my...

332
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,812
(FLAT) # Life #

333
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:03,052
- I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say.

334
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:07,055
You've made a supreme sacrifice.
You know that?

335
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,612
- A supreme sacrifice.
- It had to be done.

336
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:13,700
I've been judging the book by its cover, haven't I?

337
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,137
All these years, that's what I've been doing.

338
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:19,532
When it really comes down to it, you're one heck of a regular guy.

339
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,453
And there's no point being modest.
I know what that guitar meant to you.

340
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:29,095
It means exactly the same
as that trunk means to me.

341
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:34,858
If that trunk got so much as scratched,
I would be devastated.

342
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:40,372
It's not the outward value.
To me, that trunk is a link to the past,

343
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,340
a link to the father I never
managed to square things with...

344
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,853
- Is it?
- That trunk is the only thing he ever gave me,

345
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,456
apart from...
apart from his disappointment.

346
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:57,257
And you've shown me, by burning
your guitar, what true value really is.

347
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:03,741
Decency. Self-sacrifice. Those are
the things that make up real wealth,

348
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,417
and from where I'm standing,
I'm a pretty rich man.

349
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:10,651
- Oh, God.
- Burn the soldiers.

350
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:15,094
- No, not the soldiers, as well...
- You burned your guitar, I want to make a sacrifice, too.

351
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:18,014
Burn the Armée du Nord. Cast them to the flames.

352
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:21,412
Let them lay down their lives
for the sake of friendship.

353
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:29,334
- What's that smell?
- What smell? I can't smell any smell.

354
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,614
Camphor wood.

355
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,530
Your guitar was made of camphor wood.

356
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,654
It must have been worth a fortune.
Burn the soldiers. Burn them right now!

357
00:24:55,981 --> 00:25:00,452
Look, there they are. Mush! Mush!

358
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,413
(RIMMER TRUMPETS "LAST POST")

359
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,653
Au revoir, mes amis. A bientot.

360
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:33,771
Rimmer, there's something
I've got to tell you, something awful.

361
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:37,497
If it's about how you finished off
the dog food, Dave, I understand.

362
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:42,337
- No, it's not about that...
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Oooooow!

363
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,010
- Cat! Kryten!
- We made it, we made it!

364
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:49,414
- Food! You brought food!
- So, where have you been over the last few days?

365
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:52,739
We rendezvoused with Holly.
and then when you didn't show up after two days

366
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:56,212
- I said we should look for you.
- Yeah, we've been everywhere.

367
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:57,997
Fourteen moons, two planets.

368
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:01,251
I've been so worried, I haven't
buffed my shoes for two days!

369
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,775
So, Holly managed to navigated her way through five black holes?

370
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,575
As it transpired, there weren't any black holes.

371
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:10,739
- But you saw them on the monitor?
- They weren't black holes.

372
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:13,899
- What were they?
- Grit.

373
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:21,097
Five specks of grit on the scanner-scope.

374
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,616
See, the thing about grit is it's black,

375
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,772
and the thing about the scanner-scope...

376
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:29,133
- Oh, shut up.
- Let's go.

377
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:33,494
Something happened here, Kryten.
Something that made him and me closer.

378
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:38,053
I saw a side of Dave Lister
that I never, ever knew existed.

379
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,692
He's not an irresponsible, selfish drifter,
always out for number one.

380
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:45,330
He's a man. A man of honour.

381
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,539
Excuse me.

382
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,097
Open the trunk.

383
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,774
Kryten... get the hacksaw and follow me.

384
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,932
Where are we going?

385
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:36,096
We're going to do to Lister
what Alexander the Great once did to me.

386
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:43,459
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

387
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,932
# I'm all alone, more or less

388
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,298
# Let me fly far away from here

389
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,135
# Fun, fun, fun

390
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:56,851
# In the sun, sun, sun

391
00:27:57,021 --> 00:28:00,377
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

392
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,659
# Drinking fresh mango juice

393
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:07,132
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

394
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,861
# Fun, fun, fun

395
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,730
# In the sun, sun, sun

396
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,575
# Fun, fun, fun

397
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:20,974
 # In the sun, sun, sun #
