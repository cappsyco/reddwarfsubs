168
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,359
Kryten, Page 19, "You killed him, sir,
because he made you kill him".

169
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,354
It's all in here. He lied to us about
our deaths on the street.

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,078
That was just to throw us off.

171
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,314
He killed us by getting us to kill him
and now we're going to die too because

172
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,550
there's no one to keep us alive.

173
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,599
He's right.
In fact, I don't think I feel too well.

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,432
-Me neither.
-I think I'm going to...

175
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,433
-Check the end, see what happens.
-Oh, yeah.

176
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,634
(TYPING)

177
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,311
We can write our own end.

178
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,835
Of course, what's written happens.

179
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,319
We're free now.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,150
Hey, man, I feel like a God.

181
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,518
I feel like I've got liquid gold
coursing through every vein in my body.

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
Hey, we can get out of this.
As long as we've got this,

183
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,472
we control the world,
we can do whatever we want.

184
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,190
-I could command my own ship.
-I could get Kochanski back.

185
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,430
Woo! I could get some new sponges.

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,909
Hey, how come I didn't get a line there?

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,640
I just gave you one there.
I knew you'd be smegged off.

188
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,631
LISTER: I control everything.

189
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,395
So the rest of our loaves can be one
giant hedonistic wash fulfilment.

190
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,118
Typos, sorry guys.

191
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,157
You really think you can write
your wee out of this?

192
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,277
Hey, witch me, baby, just witch me.

193
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,432
RIMMER: He controls the world.
He can do anything he wants.

194
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,558
I could, if I wanted to, do this.

195
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,039
(VOCALISING)

196
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,034
Lister, stop. That's an order.

197
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,754
(VOCALISING)

198
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,350
(GROANS)

199
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,158
This is brilliant.

200
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,038
What's he doing?

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,909
You've git to hop me stoop him, sir.
Hop me stoop him.

202
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,194
(LAUGHS)

203
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,069
(GRUNTS)

204
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,030
(LAUGHS) Ow.

205
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,874
(GRUNTS)

206
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,236
This is absolutely awesome.

207
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,995
All right, next step. Happy ending.

208
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,117
Back off, sir.
There's no way we can get to him.

209
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,238
Whoa! I didn't type that, or that.

210
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,199
Hey, I'm not typing this, guys,
what's happened?

211
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,159
Maybe it's not the typewriter
that's controlling our world.

212
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,753
Maybe it's something else.

213
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,799
What is it with these damn things?
why do I keep making them?

214
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,998
-Useless.
-What actually is it, sir?

215
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,716
There's something inside. Blow.

216
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,632
It looks like a squid.

217
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,757
why would I be making squids?

218
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,400
That something else
that controls the world,

219
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,756
how about it's
our combined subconscious?

220
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,151
Like the time we were ambushed by the
Despair Squid?

221
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,758
On that Ocean planet?
That thing that attacked us years ago.

222
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,877
whoa, whoa, hang on a minute.

223
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,396
Are you saying the creature in the
water tank, the one that inked us,

224
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,199
was another Despair Squid?
Because I don't feel despair,

225
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,874
I feel elation, joy.

226
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,036
I've felt great since I got here.
In here I'm somebody.

227
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,637
-It's made me want to live again.
- (SHUSHING) Footsteps. Do you hear them?

228
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,599
Kochanski. I can smell her perfume.

229
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,635
I can get her back again,
kids, everything I've ever wanted.

230
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,111
But in the real world, sir,
you'll be dying. This isn't real.

231
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,793
It'll feel real.

232
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,238
-Not in your heart.
-I've got no option, Krytie.

233
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,555
This is the only chance I've got
of getting her back again.

234
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,840
Miss Kochanski's not dead, sir.

235
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,152
Those kids were right?

236
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,837
I lied to you, sir. She dumped you.
I was trying to protect you.

237
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,957
She's out there somewhere.

238
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,312
She's in here somewhere as well.
In fact, she's right behind that door.

239
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,311
In this world she loves me.

240
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,234
In fact in this world she's going to
love me until the moment I die.

241
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,755
-She's not real.
-Nobody's perfect.

242
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,758
Look, I'm becoming transparent.
I'm returning to reality.

243
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,436
Me, too. Sir!

244
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,550
(WHISPERS) I've got to stay.

245
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,150
What the hell happened there?
I need diagrams and pointy arrows.

246
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,794
Best guess our natural defences
fought back.

247
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,477
Our previous encounter with the creature
must have strengthened our antibodies.

248
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,029
Which gave us the option to choose
between realities,

249
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,909
this one or the one that started when
Kremlin Kate showed up.

250
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,838
What if monkey boy chooses
not to fight this?

251
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,790
Then he won't be coming out.

252
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,875
It seems you're undecided about which
reality you wish to live in.

253
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,712
I'm mulling it over.

254
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,593
Would you mind if I asked you
a question?

255
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,269
Shoot.

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,719
In your dreams, did you kiss me?

257
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,554
Was it good?

258
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,317
I never wanted to wake up.

259
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,879
Then don't.

260
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,793
(TYRES SCREECHING)

261
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,312
Where are you going?

262
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,195
I have to leave and get you back.

263
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,519
The real me?

264
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,470
(SCOFFS) You'll never get me.
I'm way out of your league.

265
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,714
I thought that too, but I was wrong.

266
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,673
You were right.

267
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,629
No, I'm pretty cool.
I don't take any smeg.

268
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,674
And even though I'm disgusting,
sometimes I can be quite brave.

269
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,315
-You'll never get me.
-Yeah. I will.

270
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,194
I mean, explain this.

271
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,672
How can me getting everything I've ever
wanted be caused by despair ink?

272
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,593
Analysis of the creature, sir,
suggests it's a female.

273
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,513
Male squid, female squid,
what's the difference?

274
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,318
Females can do ten squidy things at once

275
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,630
but not so good at
reversing around rocks?

276
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,758
The male defence system is an ink
that produces despair.

277
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,992
It seems that the
female ink causes the opposite.

278
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,759
What, gives you joy?

279
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,751
That's like attacking something
that retaliates

280
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,198
by giving you an Indian head massage or
an aromatherapy luxury nail treatment.

281
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,590
What kind of crazy defence mechanism
is that?

282
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,832
Well it's an ingenious one, sir,
because it means you stop attacking it.

283
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,959
Yeah. And while you're all happy-clappy,
she scarpers, right?

284
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,553
Precisely, sir.

285
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,717
How did she get on board?

286
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,312
I kinda brought her.

287
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,829
Years ago. From that Ocean planet.

288
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,796
(SINGS) I'm going to eat you,
little fishy, 'cos I like little fish.

289
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,397
Then she escaped. I knew you guys would
get mad, so I didn't say nothing.

290
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,318
Boy, has she grown?

291
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,509
So what's going to happen to her?

292
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,598
I'm thinking sushi time.

293
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,354
I'm thinking we drop her off at
the nearest ocean moon.

294
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,431
Make some happy sea life.

295
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,198
What's going to happen to everybody in
the reality we left?

296
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,078
The guys all watching us on TV.

297
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,674
Well, they'll continue to exist as a
consequence of us

298
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,832
creating them in our hallucination, sir.
It's quantum mechanics.

299
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,833
Every decision that's made
creates a new universe,

300
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,550
as do all dreams and hallucinations.
It's multiverse 101.

301
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,600
But those sad suckers will live out the
rest of their lives

302
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,196
convinced they're the real ones
and we're characters from a TV show.

303
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,910
And you know if you told them the truth,
you know what they'd probably do?

304
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,559
-Laugh.
-Yeah.

305
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,994
(ALL LAUGH)

306
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,432
They probably would.

307
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,638
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

308
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,315
# I'm all alone, more or less

309
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,711
# Let me fly far away from here

310
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,474
# Fun, fun, fun

311
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,349
# In the sun, sun, sun

# I want to lie,
shipwrecked and comatose

# Drinking fresh mango juice

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,431
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

# Fun, fun, fun
