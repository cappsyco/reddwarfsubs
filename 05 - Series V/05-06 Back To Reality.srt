("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:57,976
(KRYTEN ON RADIO) Mr Rimmer, sir, we've located
the black box terminal. You should be getting something now.

3
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:03,654
Confirmed. Ident details -
SSS Esperanto. Ocean seeding ship.

4
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,496
Mission to introduce oceanic life
to potential S3 planets.

5
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:11,177
This was a recon trip.
A three-year check, strictly routine,

6
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,299
to make sure the amino acid chain had taken.

7
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:18,972
(RIMMER) They'd been trying out some new enhancement
technique to accelerate the evolutionary process.

8
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,815
Topped even their best projections.

9
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:26,174
They got five million years of evolution
in three solar years.

10
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,691
- (WHISTLES, IMPRESSED)
- So what happened?

11
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:34,735
Final entry - routine stuff. They spent the day
cataloguing and indexing new life forms.

12
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,495
- Then it stops.
- The question which occurs:

13
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:41,700
If this ocean is supposed to be teeming with new lifeforms, where are they all?

14
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,541
- What are you implying, Kryten?
- No implication intended, sir.

15
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:48,257
Yes, there is. You're saying there's
some huge damn fish out there, aren't you?

16
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:54,497
Some kind of gigantic, weird pre-historic Leviathan
who's porked its way through this entire ocean.

17
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,420
- That is one option.
- Any alternatives?

18
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,739
- None that occur.
- Hey, wait a minute. I've got it.

19
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:04,940
- Don't fish swim south for the winter?
- No, that's birds, sir.

20
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:09,214
Birds swim south for the winter?
How do they breathe?

21
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,615
Guys.

22
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,136
Rimmer, you getting this?

23
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,696
Got it. It looks like Norman Bates's mum.

24
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,371
Human, male, Caucasian.

25
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:28,059
Cause of death - gunshot wound to the head.
From the entry and exit wounds, most likely self-inflicted.

26
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:30,019
(CAT) Here's another one!

27
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,296
- Two suicides?
- (CAT) There's more!

28
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,493
Oh, male. Oriental.
Clearly, he committed seppuku.

29
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,301
Hey! Look what I found.

30
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,936
Species - unknown. Similar to Earth haddock.

31
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,980
Cause of death - suffocation. What?

32
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,338
- (RIMMER) What is it?
- This fish suffocated in water.

33
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,651
It voluntarily closed its own gills.

34
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:57,250
Are you saying
this haddock committed suicide?

35
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,098
I'm merely stating the known facts.

36
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:05,540
This fish relinquished its life
of its own free will. Damn fool!

37
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,334
Why would a haddock kill itself?

38
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,300
Why am I even asking that question?

39
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,856
Hold on. Hang five, guys.
I'm getting something.

40
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:17,615
He committed suicide, he committed suicide,

41
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,933
he committed suicide
and the fish committed suicide.

42
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,219
There's some kind of link here that I can't put my finger on.

43
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:27,812
Hang on a minute, guys. Check this.

44
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,656
- (MACHINE BLEEPS)
- It's an unknown compound.

45
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,054
Best guess, some sort of hallucinogenic
venom secreted by a piscine source,

46
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,179
not unlike the Earth octopus or giant squid.

47
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:45,221
- This is octopus ink?
- I'm just completing a chemical analysis.

48
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,780
- Oh. Er...
- What?

49
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,131
- (KRYTEN) Come on, sir. We have to go.
- What's happening?

50
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,740
- We have to go!
- Kryten, what's going on?

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,172
- Entering air lock.
- Repressurising now.

52
00:03:56,341 --> 00:04:00,539
Some kind of sea creature, a life form we've
never encountered before, attacked this ship.

53
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,939
Its defence mechanism is a curious one.
It secretes a venom, a poison,

54
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:09,413
possibly even an hallucinogenic, which
disfunctions its prey by inducing despair.

55
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:12,932
That's why the crew members
and even that fish had committed suicide.

56
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,701
Unfortunately, we have been contaminated.

57
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:20,731
It's a greatly reduced dose
but we may experience (SOBS) moments...

58
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,211
..of despair and anguish.

59
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,372
What about Lister and the Cat?

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,659
I'm OK. I don't seem to be affected.

61
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:32,780
It's true, I don't think anyone's loved me
in my entire life,

62
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,012
but there's nothing new about that.

63
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:39,300
What's gotten into you, guys?
It's like Saturday night at The Wailing Wall.

64
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,214
Why is it always me that has to be the strong one?

65
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,214
(SOBS) Without me, you guys would just fall apart.

66
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:50,217
We should get back as soon as we can and take
a mood stabiliser. I suggest lithium carbonate.

67
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:55,618
(RIMMER) I know, emotionally, this isn't the news you want to hear right now,

68
00:04:55,781 --> 00:05:02,255
but there's a blob on the sonar scope the size
of New Mexico and it's heading your way.

69
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:06,136
I think our friend the Suicide Squid
is about to make an appearance.

70
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:10,494
- (KRYTEN) Where is it precisely?
- Directly above you, about 2,000 fathoms and diving.

71
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:15,059
(LISTER, SOBBING) Oh, thanks a lot, Rimmer. You know the
state we're in, you have to go and give us news like that?

72
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:19,971
- You couldn't have lied?
- I was lying. It's only 1,000 fathoms.

73
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,577
(KRYTEN)
We're entering Starbug's airlock now.

74
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,701
(SONAR PINGS)

75
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,292
What's it doing?

76
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:35,056
It's trying to work out
what we are. Cut the power.

77
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,771
This venom, are we safe in here?

78
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:41,576
It penetrated the hull of a
Class D Space Corps Seeding Ship.

79
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,812
In comparison, we're a sardine tin.

80
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:45,500
- It's moving.
- Where?

81
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,419
- Down.
- Speed?

82
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,931
- 15 knots... 16... 18...
- It's diving.

83
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,734
- Course?
- Collision.

84
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:55,172
- Do we move or stay?
- 25 knots... 35... 50...

85
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:56,478
It's coming straight for us.

86
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:59,818
There's only three alternatives, it thinks
we're either a threat, food or a mate.

87
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,740
It's gonna either kill us, eat us or hump us.

88
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,293
We either persuade him that we're not that kind
of oceanic salvage vessel or we scarper pronto.

89
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,937
To be diddled by a giant squid on a first date? Think how we'd feel in the morning.

90
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:16,490
OK, we're going to try and outrun it.
Holly, hit the power and give me manual.

Change bearing, one zero five. There's some
natural caverns about three klicks away.

93
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:32,018
- It might give us some cover.
- That's a yo, Holly. New course set.

- It's hit us!

(COMPUTER) For the last four years. You have been engaged
in the Total Immersion Video Game "Red Dwarf"

97
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,692
As with all role-playing adventures,

98
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:11,139
you will experience a certain amount
of disorientation on leaving the game.

99
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:15,738
It will be several minutes
before your real-life memories return.

100
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:20,259
So, in the meantime, please disengage
the game-playing machinery and relax

101
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:24,016
until an attendant is free
to answer any of your questions.

102

On behalf of Leisure World International,
may we be the first to say welcome back to reality.

This is a very, very bad dream, right?

- I'm not a hologram.
- I'm half human.

105
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,253
What the hell's happened to my teeth?!

106
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,854
I can open beer bottles with my overbite.

107
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,136
(MIDLANDS ACCENT)
All right lads. How you feeling?

108
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:08,296
Bit wonky? it's perfectly normal.
You'll be as right as rain in 20 minutes.

109
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:13,376
So, if you could just move into the recuperation lounge,
I can get things ready for the next lot.

110
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,095
- The next lot?
- Yeah, it's a very popular game is Red Dwarf.

111
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,498
It's got a two-year waiting list.
We've only got 20 machines.

112
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,331
- So, how'd you get killed, then?
- Some kind of squid.

113
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:26,095
The Despair Squid? There's no
way that should have killed you.

114
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,571
Why didn't you use the
laser cannons? It's obvious!

115
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:32,490
Starbug doesn't - didn't -
have a laser cannon capability.

116
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:37,093
You twonk! You use the laser cannons
on the crashed wotsit... Esperanto.

117
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,951
That's how you get out of it.

118
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:42,131
How were we supposed to
know that, you Brummie git?

119
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,372
Esperanto. That's a clue, isn't it?

120
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,774
Esperanto - hope.
Hope defeats despair, the Despair Squid.

121
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,455
It's a blatant clue, isn't it? Blatant.

122
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,693
Bloomin' heck, if you didn't get that, you must have been playing like puddings!

123
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:57,216
Which one was playing Lister, then?

124
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:59,975
- Me.
- Did you get Kochanski?

125
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:02,977
Was I supposed to?

126
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:07,260
Supposed to? That's the objective
of the game for Lister, you twonk.

127
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:13,053
You get separated to begin with. Then basically, it's
a love story across time, space, death and reality.

128
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:18,170
You must have got the easy stuff, though. 'Ere, what did
you think about the planet of the nymphomaniacs?

129
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:22,739
- The planet of the what?!
- What? You missed that? Oh! That's a riot, that is.

130
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:25,211
Some people spend years on that.

131
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,372
Which one was Rimmer?

132
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,737
- Me.
- Oh, he's amazing, ain't he?

133
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,740
- You can say that again.
- How long did it take for you to sus him out, then?

134
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,571
- I had him sussed right from the beginning.
- What, really?

135
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,733
You found the Captain's message right away?

136
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:42,758
What Captain's message?

137
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,577
The one that's hidden in the microdot
in the 'i' in Rimmer's swimming certificate.

138
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,700
That's the clue, isn't it? - Rimmer having a swimming
certificate and not being able to swim.

139
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:55,179
- That's a clue?
- It's a blatant clue, isn't it?!

140
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:59,056
- A blatant clue to what?
- A blatant clue to the truth behind Rimmer.

141
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:03,095
- What truth?
- The truth to why he's such an insufferable prat.

142
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,737
That's because of his parents, his upbringing,
his background. The fact he was never loved.

143
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,012
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,894
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

145
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,694
No!

146
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:17,693
- What. Was it. Then?
- He was a hand-picked special agent for the Space Corps.

147
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:21,437
He had his memory erased and was
programmed to act like a complete twonk.

148
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:27,540
So no-one would suspect he was on a secret mission to destroy Red Dwarf, in order to guide Lister to his destiny as creator of the Second Universe.

149
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:29,732
- You what?!
- Yeah.

150
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:34,657
You know that bit when Lister jump-starts the Second
Big Bang with jump leads from Starbug?

151
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:37,694
Jump starts the Second Big Bang?!

152
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:43,499
Well, that's the final irony isn't it? Lister, the ultimate
atheist, turns out, in fact, to be God.

153
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:44,997
You what?!

154
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,492
It was all in the Captain's
message. It was all in the microdot.

155
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,615
Ey, hang on a minute. Are you...?

156
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:56,971
Are you seriously telling me you were playing the prat
version of Rimmer for all this time! For four years?!

157
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:00,452
Oh-ho! Whoa, that's a classic, that is.
That's a classic.

158
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,731
All right, lads. Which one's Lister?

159
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:09,092
Right. Got your food bag, bio-feedback,
catheter... It's all there.

160
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,457
You can start plugging yourself in.

161
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,852
Here, whatever you do, don't confuse
the food pipe up with the catheter, will you?

162
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:20,255
Some bloke did that, we didn't spot it
for two days. OK, Kryten. In you go, son.

163
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,170
OK, Cat, Rimmer...
Give us a bit of room here will you, please, chaps?

164
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:27,851
Well, where do we go? We don't know who we are.
Our memories haven't returned yet.

165
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:32,020
The re-cup-er-a-tion lounge.
I keep telling you!

166
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:35,737
Blimey!
No wonder you only scored four per cent.

167
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:38,251
Cor! What a bunch of twonks.

168
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:46,530
I'm not Lister, then. I'm not me, am I?

169
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,813
None of us are who we thought we were, sir.
This is going to take some getting used to.

170
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,137
- I'm not Rimmer, then?
- No.

171
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,530
I'm not a hologram. I'm not Rimmer.

172
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,972
Well, if we're not who we thought
we were, who the hell are we?

173
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:03,698
The kind of sad acts who wanna spend
four years playing a computer game.

174
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:08,571
Either running away from God knows what
or we've got nothing worth living for in the first place.

175
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:11,978
- Is there a Duane Dibbley here?
- Pardon?

176
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:14,218
- Duane Dibbley?
- No, sorry.

177
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:19,018
Wait a minute. How do you know there's no one
called Duane Dibbley in here? It could be you.

178
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:24,580
No, this is right. Dibbley, this is the Dibbley party.
Which one's Duane Dibbley?

179
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,777
No. No, no, please, no!
I don't want to be Duane Dibbley.

180
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:40,896
It's you. Here are your party's clothes and possessions.
The medical officer will be down in 20 minutes.

181
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,661
Duane Dibbley? How can I be called Duane Dibbley?

182
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:47,940
It's true. It's got your photograph,
name, address on it and everything.

183
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,812
There's an anorak in here!

184
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:56,213
White socks... nylon shirt...

185
00:12:56,381 --> 00:13:01,091
plastic sandals... Aertex vest...

186
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:06,330
cardigan... oh, and a key
to the Salvation Army hostel.

187
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,132
It doesn't make sense.

188
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,976
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it makes perfect sense...

189
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,495
Duane!

190
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,131
Imagine a guy
with no élan, no style - a misfit.

191
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,147
Doesn't it just make total
sense that this hapless creature

192
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:26,855
would give his buck teeth to play
someone like the Cat in a computer game?

193
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,856
So this is really me?

194
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:35,334
A no-style gimbo with teeth the druids
could use as a place of worship?!

195
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,181
Kryten, open the next one.

196
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,852
Listen, whoever you are,

197
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,218
don't push your luck
by ordering whoever I am around.

198
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,102
Because almost
certainly, whoever I am,

199
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,535
I'm not the kind of guy who's going to
take any crap from whoever you are.

200
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:54,577
So before you start ordering me around, let's establish if
I'm the kind of guy who doesn't mind being ordered around,

201
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:59,656
or if I'm the kind of guy who gets all uptight being
ordered around by whatever the kind of guy you are. Clear?

202
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:02,250
All I said was,
"Open the next one."

203
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:05,973
- All right, this one's you.
- Oh. Who am I?

204
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:10,173
Wow! You're a detective

205
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,333
in the Cybernautic Division
of the police department.

206
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,260
Oh... ha... Golly. Really?

207
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:20,091
- Yeah. This is your badge.
- A detective, huh? What's my name?

208
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,815
Jake. Jake Bullet.

209
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,651
Jake Bullet, Cybernautic Detective. I like that.

210
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,614
That sounds
like the kind of hard-living flatfoot

211
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:37,058
who gets the job done by cutting
corners and bucking authority.

212
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:40,333
And if those pen-pushers up
at City Hall don't like it,

213
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:44,893
they can park their overpaid
fat asses on this mid-digit

214
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:50,340
and swivel, swivel till they squeal
like pigs on a honeymoon!

215
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:57,377
On the other hand, Mr Bullet, perhaps the
Cybernautics Division is in charge of traffic control,

216
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,135
and you just happen to have a rather silly macho name.

217
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,936
Oh, yes. That's a good point, sir.
I didn't think of that.

218
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,132
Duane Dibbley?

219
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,176
So, whoever you are, who's next?

220
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:16,178
- I don't want to know. Someone else look.
- Stand aside. Let the law handle this.

221
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:21,379
Hmm... No photograph. Name - Billy Doyle.

222
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:25,338
Not necessarily. It's not necessarily me.

223
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:29,381
Billy Doyle. Well, that's a name that came
from the wrong side of the tracks, isn't it?

224
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,580
You can see it all now - a youth spent
in and out of corrective institutions,

225
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,732
a string of illegitimate children,

226
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,781
the wife will be all white shoes,
no tights and blotchy legs,

227
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:43,218
has to take up petty crime to cover the
court orders for maintenance.

228
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:46,976
Before he knows it, he's standing
in a bank with a sawn-off shotgun.

229
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:52,932
Somehow it goes off. An old lady gets both
barrels through a crocheted bobble hat.

230
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:57,095
All he can do is hide.
But where? And then it hits him.

231
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:02,700
With his ill-gotten gains he can buy four years
in a computer game, and wait 'til the heat's off.

232
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,138
So ends the ballad
of Billy "Granny Killer" Doyle.

233
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,657
It's yours.

234
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:13,451
- What?
- It's yours... Bill.

235
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:17,894
- No.
- Check the ugly mug on the ID, then, man.

236
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,052
"William Doyle".

237
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:24,135
William Doyle. Good ol Bill Doyle.

238
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:27,532
You know that sounds like
a hell of a good name to me.

239
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:32,298
Probably connected with the Boston Doyles.
Old money, blue-chip stock.

240
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,657
You know, I think it's all
coming back to me now.

241
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:39,416
What puzzles me slightly is what a
man of such undoubted good breeding

242
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,102
would be doing wearing a coat
that smells like an elderly make yak

243
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,452
that has taken a leak
in both the pockets.

244
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,261
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- No, it isn't.

245
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:55,413
Oh, my God. My name is Billy Doyle
and my cologne is Eau de Yak Urine.

246
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,371
So who am I, then?

247
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,021
Wow! Look at my gear!

248
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,095
This stuffs really, really expensive.

249
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,656
Are you quite absolutely sure this isn't my box?

250
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:23,174
- Who are you? What do you do?
- I work for some company - CGI.

251
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:26,254
I've got a Limo in the long-term car park.

252
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:30,858
Well clearly, you were privy to all the breaks and
advantages that life denied poor old William Doyle here.

253
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:37,579
Sir, I think you should take a look at this.
William, meet your brother Sebastian.

254
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:45,217
Well, half-brothers. Uterinal - same mother.

255
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,971
This is a crazy idea, we can't leave now.
Our memories haven't returned yet.

256
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,358
We've got to find out
more about ourselves.

257
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:58,296
I refuse to accept I'm his alky,
dropout, yak-coat-wearing half-brother.

258
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,897
Duane Dibbley?!

259
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:10,452
(DRIVING ROCK MUSIC)

260
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:17,332
Are you crazy, Lister? Are you totally nuts?

261
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,778
You risk your own neck and everyone else's
just to save my life?

262
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,979
- You do that again and I'll kill you.
- Hey, Kochanski.

263
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,737
Shut up.

264
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:48,654
"Vote Fascist for a third glorious decade
of total law enforcement"?!

265
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:52,530
"Be a government informer.
Betray your family and friends"?

266
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:55,375
"Fabulous prizes to be won"?!

267
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,372
Here it is.

268
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:11,851
- This is your car?
- Bay 47.

269
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,577
Halt or I'll fire! Move, voters!

270
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:20,491
Move one inch and I'll crush
every bone in your body.

271
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,418
You helped an enemy of democracy escape.

272
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,414
She was stealing an apple of the people.

273
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,977
- Bullet, cybernautics.
- That's traffic control.

274
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,496
Kneel, voters.

275
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,892
You are under sentence of death.

276
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,975
Come out of the shadows, voter.

277
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,497
What's the beef?
Did she steal your lunch box?

278
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:54,019
M-Many apologies, Voter Colonel.
Had I known it was you, I...

279
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,332
- Forgive me.
- You know me?

280
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,657
Of course, Voter Colonel.

281
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:06,094
- Who am I?
- You are Colonel Sebastian Doyle.

282
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:10,858
Section chief of CGI.
Head of the Ministry of Alteration.

283
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:16,932
Remind me a little. What exactly do we do
at the Ministry of Alteration?

284
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:21,260
You... change people, Voter Colonel.

285
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,419
- In what way?
- You change them from being alive people

286
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:29,972
to being dead people, to purify democracy.

287
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,618
Purify?

288
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:35,978
No one has done more to purge
the ballot boxes than the Voter Colonel.

289
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:42,860
- So why has he been away for four years?
- Excuse me, Voter Colonel, but is this some sort of test?

290
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,859
Answer him.

291
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:50,697
The rumour was that you had grown weary
of your glorious duties

292
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:56,300
and had gone away,
in secret, to renew yourself.

293
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:02,493
- Halt!
- (GUNFIRE)

294
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,931
I killed him.

295
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,857
Lets get out of here! In the car!

296
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:17,337
- Get in the car!
- I killed him!

297
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,492
We haven't got time for that, Kryten! In the car!

298
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,898
- I killed a human!
- In the car!

299
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:28,170
Look out! Fascist cops by the lift, and they're armed!

300
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,694
You're hit!

301
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,781
(HOLLY) Hello. For the 3,000th time,
you're hallucinating. Can anyone hear me?

302
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,932
Uh-oh! Speed bumps!

303
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,419
Chicane!

304
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,812
Look out. The barrier.

305
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,416
Brace yourselves! We're going through it!

306
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:58,496
Motorcycles.
They're carrying personal rocket launchers.

307
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,534
- That bridge, think we can make it?
- It's raising!

308
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:04,893
- Got any better ideas?
- Just do it!

309
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,938
Whooooa!

310
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:16,975
We made it! Nice driving! So long, suckers!

311
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,381
Uh-oh! Helicopters.

312
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:25,853
Oh, I'm going to have to dump the limo!

313
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:31,334
OK! Come on! Go! Go! Go!

314
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,690
Down that alley!

315
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,420
I killed him. I killed a human.

316
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,060
- (CLICKS)
- Damn.

317
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,509
What are you doing?!

318
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:56,421
It is fundamental to me, never to take
a life, no matter what the provocation.

319
00:22:56,581 --> 00:23:00,370
I could have stunned him. I killed him.
I must terminate myself.

320
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:05,411
This is a nightmare. I'm on the run from the fascist police
with a murderer and a mass murderer

321
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,970
and a man in a bri-nylon shirt.

322
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:13,341
I'm just a flotsam-jetsam human-wreckage sputum-bag
who smells like a yak latrine.

323
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:18,701
Now my best flashing mac is about to get splattered with an
android's brain. I'm after you with the gun.

324
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:21,171
- Yeah, count me in too.
- Ditto.

325
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,617
But there's only one bullet left.

326
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:28,776
We could all put our heads together
and the bullet could go down the line.

327
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:32,770
Kryten, I'm broadcasting on a higher frequency.
Can you hear me now?

328
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:37,214
- Did somebody say something?
- You're hallucinating. Put the gun down.

329
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:40,652
I think I'm going to put the gun down.

330
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:46,539
- Walk forward three paces.
- I think I'm going to walk forward three paces.

331
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,507
Well, he's cracking up.

332
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:55,091
I have a strange compulsion to pick up this
fire extinguisher and twist the release wheel.

333
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,451
Have you quite finished being strange?

334
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:03,890
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what came over me.

335
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,091
- OK?
- OK.

336
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,537
(HOLLY) You're hallucinating.

337
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,732
You're hallucinating.

338
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,972
- What?
- I thought you weren't going to make it.

339
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:17,491
- Welcome back to reality!
- What happened?

340
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:21,854
You had a group hallucination,
brought on by the ink from the Despair Squid.

341
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:27,937
You were about to commit suicide just like the crew
of the Esperanto, 'til the mood-stabiliser saved you.

342
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:31,731
- The lithium carbonate.
- What? We really would have killed ourselves?

343
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:36,452
Of course. The hallucinations
were designed to induce despair.

344
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:41,741
To attack the very things we each consider
quintessential to our self-esteem.

345
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:46,498
Take Mr Rimmer. Back there, he could no longer blame
his failings and shortcomings on his parents,

346
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,820
because he shared an upbringing with you, sir,
his richer, more important half-brother.

347
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:54,497
The Cat lost his cool, and life
for him no longer had any meaning

348
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,891
because he is so mind-meltingly shallow.

349
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:59,980
Right. Superficial is my middle name.

350
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:05,815
And you, sir. You have always prided yourself
on being a good man, a man of moral courage.

351
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:10,896
So, when you thought you were a mass-murdering
butcher in a totalitarian state? Despair.

352
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,940
Despair destined to drive you over the edge.

353
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,701
- And with you it was taking a human life.
- Precisely.

354
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:21,859
- I'm not Duane Dibbley?
- No.

355
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:24,052
I AM Rimmer?

356
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,019
I'm afraid so.

357
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:31,691
- So... what happened to the Despair Squid?
- I took care of that. Limpet mines.

358
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:34,740
There's enough fried calamari
out there to feed the whole of Italy.

359
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:38,377
- Well, I say let's get out of here.
- (HOLLY) Flight coordinates programmed.

360
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,976
Switching to pilot cooperation
until we surface.

361
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:48,300
Those planet engineers really screwed up
in a big way here, didn't they? Playing God.

362
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:54,099
The evolutionary process threw up a life form so
much stronger and more deadly than any other species.

363
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,014
Damn near wiped out everything on the entire planet.

364
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,175
Spreading despair and destruction
wherever it stuck its ugly mush.

365
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:06,854
Hmm, sounds rather reminiscent of a species
sitting not a million miles away from me now.

366
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:09,012
(CHORTLES)

367
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,615
You probably have to be a mechanoid
to fully appreciate that one.

368
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,100
Kryten, no one likes a smart alec android.

369
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,531
Hit the retros.

370
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:21,692
We're on our way, sir.

371
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,177
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

372
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,652
# I'm all alone, more or less

373
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,939
# Let me fly far away from here

374
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:41,741
# Fun, fun, fun

375
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:45,610
# In the sun, sun, sun

376
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:49,058
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

377
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:52,339
# Drinking fresh mango juice

378
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,698
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

379
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,580
# Fun, fun, fun

380
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:02,291
# In the sun, sun, sun

381
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:05,055
# Fun, fun, fun

382
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:09,375
# In the sun, sun, sun #
