("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,254
Amazing.
The last strawberry in the universe.

3
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,257
Calibrator locked and set.
Organic infrastructure recorded and stored.

4
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,974
Engage the triplicator.

5
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,576
- (HISSES)
- It works!

6
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,414
- What works?
- We've adapted the matter paddle.

7
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,453
Only now the returning signal is split three ways,

8
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,217
so as well as receiving the original object,
we also get two identical copies.

9
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,815
This will solve all our supply problems.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,216
Taking into account the
computations for recalibration,

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,896
I think we can produce four,
perhaps even five strawberries a week.

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,296
Well, I don't know if the Nobel
Prize people run a fruit section,

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,813
but if they do, you've got
to be this year's hot tip.

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,611
Gentlemen, history beckons.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,893
You'll be famous. They'll build your statues,
even name towns after you.

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,569
"Dorksville" springs instantly to mind.

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,096
- This machine could revolutionise our lives.
- Absolutely.

18
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,065
With this little baby
running at full pelt,

19
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,494
I confidently predict we could have a
full fruit salad by the end of the year.

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,570
Look, it's not just strawberries. This machine can duplicate anything. It can...

21
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,411
Sir, what's wrong?

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,096
This strawberry's incredible! So succulent.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,251
It's divine.

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,819
- Is that the same?
- Oh, no, no!

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,257
- How's it different?
- It's bitter, rancid.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,536
- Sir, I, um...
- Kind of tangy.

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,691
- Sir, ...
- Crunchy.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,976
- Sir.
- Tangy. Kind of chewy.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,213
Meaty, even. It's a...
funny kind of wriggly texture.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,979
Oh, smeg!

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,775
It's as if the triplicator has extracted all the very best elements
out of one duplicate

32
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,056
and the very worst from the other.

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,731
So what would happen if
we reversed the process?

34
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,571
Ah yes.

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,334
Nice experiment, guys. What do you do
for an encore? Neutron bomb juggling?

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,929
- (ALARM SOUNDS)
- Rude alert! Rude alert!

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,650
An electrical fire has knocked out
my voice recognition unicycle.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,934
Many Wurlitzers are missing from my database.
Abandon shop! This is not a daffodil!

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,250
Repeat. This is not a daffodil.

40
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,653
Well, thankfully Holly's unaffected.

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,896
She's right! The engine core is approaching
critical mass. We'll have meltdown in less than 15 minutes!

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,975
Er, I think a brisk stroll in the direction of the cargo bay
could be an outstanding career move at this point.

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,131
Are you really saying Red Dwarf's gonna blow?

44
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,332
In less time than it takes a Norwegian to buy ski boots.

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,052
Hey, guys! I think they're playing our tune "The Awooga Waltz". Anyone care to join me in a quickstep?

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,491
(RIMMER) Holly, open cargo bay doors.

47
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,216
(NERVOUSLY) Er, Holly, those cargo bay doors
we talked about earlier,

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,653
- would you mind opening them, please?
- Holly! The doors, Holly!

49
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:46,898
The phrase "Cargo bay doors"
does not appear to be in my lexicon.

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,330
- Manual override!
- The phrase "Manual override" doesn't a-

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,298
Oh, forget it!

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,059
That's eighty klicks. We should be clear
of any possible blast zone.

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,898
- You really think it's going to blow?
- This can't be happening.

54
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,014
Nothing's gonna happen.
We're just here as a precaution.

55
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,820
The whole ship's full of fail-safes anyway -

56
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,018
cooling systems,
containment panels, vacuum shields...

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,490
The chances of it blowing are about one in...

58
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,138
..one.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,811
Well, according to the charts,

60
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,769
the nearest asteroid
with an S3 atmosphere is six hours away.

61
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,773
The trouble is we only have enough fuel for five hours' flight.

62
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,416
I don't think that's going to prove
to be a major problem, though,

63
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,574
because we only have enough
oxygen for seven minutes.

64
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,059
(MUTTERS) Well, that doesn't really affect us, does it?

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,611
- (MUTTERS) Sorry, sir?
- We don't need oxygen.

66
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,536
Now, here's a thought. If we
ejected their corpses into outer space,

67
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,858
would the weight reduction
allow us to reach the asteroid?

68
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,651
- Come on, Rimmer, that's not the attitude.
- Sorry?

69
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,609
That's not the Red Dwarf way.
One in trouble, all in trouble.

70
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,811
- The posse.
- Boys from the Dwarf.

71
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,530
- If one of us is in a fix, the Homeboys band together.
- That's the way it is.

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,129
Have you got anything in writing?

73
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,130
You're a toad, Rimmer. You're a weasel.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,134
You're a slimy river-dwelling rodent
with the morals of a praying mantis.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,049
I'm just being a realist. Look, you only have seven minutes left to live.

76
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,292
That's tragic. God, it's tragic!

77
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,298
- But for the rest of us, life must go on.
- If I may interject, sir, in your case that's not exactly true.

78
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,977
Remember, you are operating on emergency
battery supplies. We have no spares.

79
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,896
In fact, you yourself, sir, will expire
in a little under four minutes.

80
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,054
...OK, homeboys, let's posse!

81
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,773
- Right, Kryten, get a radar scope, scan the wreckage.
- Straight away, sir.

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,058
Cat, get suited up. Maybe
some oxygen tanks have survived.

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,976
Maybe some fuel tanks. If we get a fix, and
we can get out there, and bring them on-board.

84
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,819
Meanwhile, turn Rimmer down to minimum power. That way it'll triple his running time.

85
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,290
Sirs, there's something out there.

86
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,452
Two objects, far too vast to be debris.

87
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,250
According to the backlog,
they materialised just before the explosion.

88
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,572
- Can we get in any closer?
- Enhance maximum.

89
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,936
(COMPUTER WHIRRS)

90
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,451
(KRYTEN) Of course. The triplicator has made two copies of Red Dwarf.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,456
How?

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,891
Well, presumably, when I
threw the triplicator into reverse

93
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,611
it didn't reverse the process, it reversed the field
of the beam. Projecting it out, not in.

94
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,778
So, instead of the copying the strawberries,
it copied the entire ship?

95
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,931
Precisely. And presumably, the resultant power
drain exposed the engine's core, and caused the original to blow.

96
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,815
So, like the strawberries,
there are two new Red Dwarfs,

97
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,971
one succulent and divine,

98
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,780
- the other...
- Fish bait.

99
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,855
So what's the problem? We got us a ship. And from what you're saying it should be better than the original.

100
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,497
- Not quite.
- In the lab, the triplicated copies had a limited lifespan.

101
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,260
- How limited?
- About an hour.

102
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,818
Well, there may be a solution. The contents
of the ship should be triplicated too.

103
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,696
So, there will be a working triplicator on-board
whichever of the ships is the superior.

104
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,329
You see, theoretically, we can reverse the reversal

105
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,613
and replicate the original Red Dwarf
by amalgamating the two copies.

106
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,499
He makes it sound so simple.

107
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,016
We have to find a terminal to re-boost
Mr Rimmer's battery pack. We'll catch you up.

108
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,214
(CELESTIAL MUSIC)

109
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,171
Check that music. It's magnificent!
I never heard anything like it before.

110
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,696
(INHALES) Ooh!
Get a lungful of that air, man!

111
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,739
Hmm! Makes you feel good to be alive.

112
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,655
Everything about this ship is...
well, it's divine.

113
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,130
Hey, let's check the food.

114
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,011
- What did you order?
- Ultimate test - Pot Noodle.

115
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,015
(BOTH) Mmm!

116
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,973
I tell you one thing, I've been to a parallel
universe, I've seen time running backwards,

117
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,098
I've played pool with planets
and I've given birth to twins,

118
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,255
but I never thought in my entire life
I'd taste an edible Pot Noodle.

119
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,451
Brothers, we bid you welcome.

120
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,617
There must be much
you do not understand. Come.

121
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,290
You're me but you're not me...?

122
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,489
I am part of you, your higher self. Your spiritual side.
I exist in you as potential.

123
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,379
Now I'm here, extrapolated from your being.

124
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,817
Extrapo-what-alated?
Buddy, there is no way are you part of me.

125
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,860
No part of me would ever be seen alive in sandals.

126
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,533
I find clothes a distraction from the pursuit
of spiritual and intellectual fulfilment.

127
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,778
That's weird because I find spiritual
and intellectual fulfilment

128
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,893
a distraction from the pursuit of clothes.

129
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,015
Let us join our friends in the meditation
chamber. Perhaps then we can spend a profitable evening

130
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,219
seeking out answers to the metaphysical conundra
that have plagued mankind since time began.

131
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,372
- Sounds wild.
- Hold me back.

132
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,492
Philosophy, poetry, music and study.
That is how we spend our time.

133
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,858
Trying to expand our minds and unlock our
full potential in the service of humankind.

134
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,491
What a pair of losers.

135
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,259
Oh! More visitors. Come, soul-sibling,
let us prepare some refreshments.

136
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,409
May your path lead to wisdom,
and in wisdom know ye peace.

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,016
These guys are supposed
to be part of us? I don't buy it.

138
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,356
These are our higher selves. They are
the people we could have become

139
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,898
if all the negative aspects of
our characters were removed.

140
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,014
- You mean hippies?
- With respect sir, you think Jesus was a hippy.

141
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,975
Well, he was. He had long hair and he didn't
have a job. What more do you want?

142
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,815
How come they're so much smarter than we are?

143
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,315
This is my guess - your mind records everything. Everything
you see, hear, every word you read, every conversation.

144
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,336
It's all stored in
your subconscious.

145
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,458
Somehow, our higher selves
have access to that knowledge.

146
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,437
Look, I'm getting itchy feet here.
You got the gizmo, let's scram

147
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:53,850
before the Mad Monk Brothers rope us into an evening
of philosophical musings and self-flagellation.

148
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,893
It's not that simple. This triplicator
has only half the vital components.

149
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,779
We need the second triplicator from the "low" ship.

150
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,335
(DING!)

151
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,371
Let the entertainment begin.

152
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,609
There will be haiku readings, poetry recitals
and musings on the inner soul.

153
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,169
But first, music and dance.

154
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,695
Brother Rimmer is portraying agony.

155
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,500
The agony of the soul as he searches out the truth.

156
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,374
The truth danced by Brother Cat.

157
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,736
(DING!)

158
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,895
- But truth is elusive.
- It flits like a firefly through the cold night of the soul,

159
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,971
teasing, confusing.

160
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,050
And agony, in torment,

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,138
Holly's back!

328
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,133
Mr Lister, wake up, sir. It's over, we're safe now.

329
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,652
Engaging autopilot.
Course zero zero mark zero. Taking her home.

330
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,329
See what you did to my blouson? Look at it.

331
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,652
- Plus, you almost killed me three times.
- Sorry, it wasn't my fault.

332
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,018
- Once you get one of them things in you, you just go kind of-
- Sir, what's wrong?

333
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,373
- I think he just sat on the spinal implant.
- But it doesn't make sense. Who's controlling him?

334
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,939
(SNIGGERING)

335
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,813
I'd better remove the implant and destroy it once and for all.

336
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,493
Uh-uh. Wait a minute. Just give me one week, that's all I ask.

337
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,731
What are you talking about?

338
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,050
Boy, this is gonna be fun.

339
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,529
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

340
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,579
# I'm all alone, more or less

341
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,937
# Let me fly far away from here

342
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,740
# Fun, fun, fun

343
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,530
# In the sun, sun, sun

344
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,977
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

345
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,292
# Drinking fresh mango juice

346
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,657
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

347
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,494
# Fun, fun, fun

348
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,210
# In the sun, sun, sun

349
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,133
# Fun, fun, fun

350
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,339
# In the sun, sun, sun #
