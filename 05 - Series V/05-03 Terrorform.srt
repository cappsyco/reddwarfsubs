I don't want it to go all wonky.
Use as much of you as possible.

59
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,531
Sir, a couple of brief points. Firstly,
you are not a qualified service engineer

60
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,172
and consequently sawing me in two
will invalidate my guarantee.

61
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:58,017
Secondly, I wouldn't trust you to open
a can of sardines that was already open.

62
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:05,093
Ooh! You're right! He really isn't dead!

63
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,332
I owe you 20.

64
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,500
- Kryten, you OK?
- I think so, sir.

65
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:15,301
There's a few bits and bobs left over,

66
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:18,658
but it's always the same when you try a bit of do-it-yourself, isn't it?

67
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:22,934
- Where's Mr Rimmer?
- We were just gonna ask you that.

68
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,092
- What happened?
- Well, there are gaps.

69
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:31,291
I remember Mr Rimmer spotted an S3 planet on the scope
and wanted to claim it on behalf of the Space Corps.

70
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,464
As usual, the ceremony
consisted of planting the flag

71
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,491
and singing all 23 stanzas
of the Space Corps anthem.

72
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:43,336
Then the planet started to erupt around us,
which, frankly, came as something of a relief.

73
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,139
- A moonquake?
- Worse.

74
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:52,535
It was as if the entire planet was reshaping,
terraforming itself as we watched.

75
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,772
- And then?
- Then things got a bit sketchy.

76
00:07:54,941 --> 00:08:00,220
I remember an explosion and then blackness.
And then I remember Mr Rimmer screaming.

77
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,851
I have an image of his face
twisted with fear, pain, anguish, dread...

78
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,012
absolutely mortified.

79
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:10,101
Did someone suggest
he pick up the tab for lunch?

80
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:13,536
Something took him. Something awful.

81
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:16,779
Can we track him Holly, can
you get a trace on his light bee?

82
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,894
Got him. Klick and a half due south.

83
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:24,493
Suggest we continue the journey by land, sir.
I'll lower the caterpillar tracks.

84
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:29,218
I think I've just worked out
what that missing circuit board is for, sir.

88
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,657
- Getting anything?
- My guess is this is a psi-moon.

89
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,138
- Psi-moon?
- An artificial planetoid.

90
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:54,011
It tunes into an individual's psyche
and adapts its terrain to mimic his mental state.

91
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,371
In this instance I believe it reconfigured itself

92
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,135
using Mr Rimmer's subconscious as a template.

93
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:04,177

- We are interlopers inside Mr Rimmer's mind.

If this planet's Rimmer's mind, what is it that took him?

97
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,696
All his neuroses, all his personal demons
will be incarnated here, made flesh.

98
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:23,053
- Example?
- Well, each person's mindscape is unique,

99
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:29,331
but we could well encounter, say, Mr Rimmer's lust
personified as some kind of slobbering rampaging beast.

100
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,737
Rimmer's lust monster?

101
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,017

is dominated by one drive.

103
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:42,930
In some cases, it might be ambition.
In others greed, envy, or the desire to please.

104
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:46,731
Whatever it is that took Mr Rimmer, we can
only pray that its intentions are benign.

105

danger. I mean, he's a hologram.

a physical form until he leaves.

right to a phone call.

we're almost on top of him.

tongues and your full sensual lips to caress my erogenous zones

You have been prepared for him.

This Master character - and I acknowledge
I may not want to know the full answer to this one -

145
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,336
why does he want me oiling particularly?

146
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:40,018
Obviously, whatever he has in mind is
facilitated by my being slippery and pliant. Yes?

147
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:48,054
He always likes his victims to be oiled. An oiled body is so much better for conducting the electricity.

be in far bigger trouble than any of us ever suspected.

He's right, sir. This is a psi-moon.

- Metaphorically, yes, sir.
- Self-loathing?

I don't loathe myself.
What is there one could possibly loathe about me?

Would you like the list, sir?

229
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,097
What list?

230
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:07,211
Well, there's the fact that you were despised by
your parents for failing to achieve their standards.

231
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:12,820
The fact that your three brothers were all such high-flyers in the Space
Corps, and you ended up servicing chicken soup machines.

232
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:17,094
There's your inability to form long-term
relationships with anyone, your cowardliness,

233
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,537
your lack of charm, honour or grace

234
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,217
and the awful knowledge
that throughout your entire life, no one has ever truly liked you

235
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:25,497
because you are so fundamentally unlikeable.

00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:53,975
OK. I say let's get into the jet-powered rocket pants
and Junior Birdman the hell out of here.

244
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:58,294
An excellent and inventive suggestion, sir,
with just two tiny drawbacks -

245
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,256
(A) we don't have
any jet-powered rocket pants,

246
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:06,130
and (B) there's no such thing
as jet-powered rocket pants

00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:10,010
outside the fictional serial
"Robbie Rocket Pants".

248
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:14,419

on an otherwise damn fine plan.

- Where do you think I'm going?

257
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:46,094
You heard him. If I don't hand myself over, he's
going to throw everything he's got at Starbug.

258
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:48,346
What? You're really
going to give yourself up?

259
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,694
No. I'm going down to the engine room
to cower behind one of the boilers.

260
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:55,092
I suggest you all find ingenious
places to tremble behind, too.

00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,143
If you want my opinion, the only way
anyone's gonna get out of here alive

262
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,137
is by working out some
way of killing that thing.

263
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,265
How? The bazookoids were totally
ineffective against it. It's invulnerable.

264
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,261

- (POUNDING THUD)

274
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:48,376
Sirs, I think I have it. The real enemy
is not out there. it is in Starbug with us.

275

and everything's cool, right?

No, wait a minute.
That's gone right up my flagpole, Kryten.

- What?

279
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:04,925
When we first drove back
the beast in the cavern,

280
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,774
it wasn't bazookoid fire
that forced him into the pit.

281
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:10,694
- It was when you told Rimmer that we wouldn't desert him.
- Precisely.

282
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:13,814
So if we make Rimmer feel wanted, feel cared about...

283
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:19,095
If we can make him feel good about himself,
somehow restore his self-esteem and his pride,

284
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:21,901
that would automatically vanquish the self-loathing beast,

285
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:25,329
or at least debilitate it long enough
for us to break free of this quicksand

286
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:27,090
and get off this
god-forsaken psi-moon.

287
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:31,772
How do we make him feel good?
What is there about him to feel good about?

288
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:35,258
- We've got to tell him we love him.
- Oh! You're sick!

289
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:39,819
- I want no part of this depravity.
- And he must not suspect we are insincere.

290
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:42,780
Our lives depend on it. Ready?

291
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,739
I'll never be ready.

292
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:56,099
Listen, we've been talking and the three of us have decided
to stay with you and face the danger.

293
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:58,332
- All for one and that, y'know?
- Really?

294
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:03,456
Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity to say
that you are a very beautiful person.

295
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:06,897
What he means is that we're
all facing certain death here,

296
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:10,611
and I think it's about time we let each other
know exactly how we feel about each other.

297
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,325
You think that's a good idea?

298
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:17,100
- It's just that guys generally aren't terrific at, you know...
- Expressing their feelings.

299
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:19,815
Yeah. They kid around
and insult each other and stuff.

300
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:24,054
And what they really mean is...
Well, they can't say the stuff they really mean.

301
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:28,892
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I'm just trying to say, that whatever happens here

302
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:32,611
I want you to know... I really care about you.

303
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,771
We all do, sir.

304
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:44,820
It's true. They really do care about you.

305
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:50,016
Only this morning you referred to me
a cancerous polyp on the anus of humanity.

306
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,371
In an affectionate way.

307
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,181
In a kidding around, joking, friendly, affectionate way.

308
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,534
Sir, what he's trying to say is, we may never get
another opportunity to articulate our feelings,

309
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:04,411
and, for one, I would like to take this opportunity
to say that you're a splendid man,

310
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:08,814
a much-respected colleague
and a, goshdarn it, damn good friend!

311
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,619
- We're getting some lift.
- Wait a minute.

312
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:16,534
- I know why you're doing this.
- Going down.

313
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:20,307
You're trying to make me feel guilty,
aren't you? It's a transparent attempt

314
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:22,538
to shame me into doing
the honourable thing.

315
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,540
- Get outta town. That's ridiculous.
- Not at all. No, what gave you that idea?

316
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:28,096
- Why, then?
- Our number's up here.

317
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:30,980
And I don't want to go out without setting the record straight.

318
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:36,170
It's not easy saying this one man to another,
but... I love you, man.

319
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,077
- I really, really love you.
- Going up.

320
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:46,820
I think it might be a good idea at this time if we try and
get into a kind of four-way hug situation.

321
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:48,078
What's wrong with you?

322
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:51,418
I don't think people touch enough,
sir. I think people should touch more.

323
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:54,095
I love you, Arnie. This is a beautiful man, Big Man.

324
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,936
- This is a beautiful moment.
- You're a big man. We love you, AJ!

325
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:01,179
Quick get in the cockpit.
There's something very strange happening out there.

327
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:16,897
Charge, my hordes of darkness.
Bring me the head of the Despicable One.

329
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,012
Have at you, Bitterness!

330
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:29,692
Take that, Self-Doubt!

331
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:37,131
Die like the dog you are, Mistrust!

332
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:41,778
Feel my blade, Loneliness.
May your foulness rot in hell.

333
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,332
We're getting some lift.

334
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,451
20 metres, that's enough for lift-off.

335
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:51,692
We're almost clear.

336
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:00,254
- It was all baloney, wasn't it?
- Well, what was?

337
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:04,011
All that hugging stuff back there.
It was just a way of escaping, wasn't it?

338
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:07,563
I mean, you didn't really feel that
deep down I'm an OK sort of bloke,

339
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:10,132
that I'm not such a bad
old stick once you get to know me.

340
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,975
You didn't really mean
any of that, did you?

341
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:15,538
(ALL THREE) No.

# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere
