Wait a minute. I'm in charge of security
and surveillance aboard this vessel.

00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,734
I, Mr Kryten, am the one
who says "Launch scouter".

7
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,972
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't mean to steal your thunder.

8
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,691
Launch scouter.

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,849
Launch scouter.

I'll be in the stern, correlating the, uh...

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,413
in the stern.

12
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,769
Would you be so good
as to launch the scouter, sir?

13
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,931
Ave-aye, sir!

14
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,891
Scouter launched, sir!

15
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,216
Sir, it appears we've encountered
a scientific research centre.

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,334
- And someone's in there, man. A survivor.
- A Dr Hildegarde Lanstrom.

17
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,419
Clearly, I am superfluous
to this entire operation,

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,973
ably commanded as it is by a droid
who was created purely to clean lavatories,

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,337
so I really don't know why you are
telling me all this, Captain Bog-Bot.

20
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,219
She's a hologram.

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,051
I'm afraid we're going to have to commandeer your
remote projection unit in order to rescue her, sir.

22
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,654
Oh, I see. First of all, I'm deemed unsuitable
to issue the command "launch scouter",

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,213
and now I'm being bundled into an escape pod
and relieved of my duties by Commander U-Bend.

24
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,369
Rimmer, why are you taking this so personal.
It's the only way to get her back to the ship.

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,016
- Why do we need another hologram on board?
- She's a doctor, sir.

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,139
- She would be a valuable asset to the team.
- And as usual, it's left to me

27
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,530
to point out the fatal flaw in your logic.

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,210
- Flaw?
- This vessel, gentlemen and khazi droids...

29
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,853
 the crimson short one up there, can only
sustain one hologram, or had you forgotten?

- You hadn't forgotten?
- Look, we'll work something out.

Some kind of "timeshare" thing.

What do you mean? What do you
think I am, a holiday villa in the Algarve?

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,892
Sir, might I remind you, as Space Corps
Directive 169 quite clearly states...

34
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,327
Holly, prepare an escape pod.

35
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,458
Anything to save me from another
(MIMICS KRYTEN) "Space Corps Directive".

Sir, the Space Corps Directives are there to protect us.

37
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,536
They're not a set of vindictive pronouncements
directed against any one person.

38

Has anyone ever seen this legendary
Space Corps Directive manual?

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,935
- Well, no.
- He's making it up isn't he?

40
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,570
- The bloody book doesn't exist.
- Sir, I assure you...

41
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,057
Why does he only ever use them against
me, why are they never against Lister?

42
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,609
Why do we never hear him
quoting Space Corps Directives

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,456
that clearly state, "No crew member should floss
his teeth with the E-string of his guitar

44
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,899
"after spraying the entire contents of his Sugar Puff
sandwich all over his superior's bunk."

45
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,735
- We never hear that one, do we?
- Holly, kindly furnish Mr Rimmer

46
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,495
with a hologrammatic copy
of the Space Corps Directive manual.

47
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,216
- Come on. Where is it?
- That's it?!

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,691
You should be able to study it at your
leisure on your trip back to Red Dwarf, sir.

49
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,376
- You've changed, you know that?
- Changed?

They may not see it, but I do.
I know what's going on.

- You're merely a mechanoid, that's all you're 'merely'.

Oh, brutal.

There's no need for alarm, sir. If there were
dangerous viral strains in the atmosphere,

61
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,531
the psi-scan would have
picked them up by now.

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,334
Well, if I can just beg your indulgences for just a few seconds more, sir.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,414
The old 345 takes a little time to warm up.

68
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,016
Still, it out-performs the 346
in eight out of nine bench tests.

69
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,971
A small wonder, then, that it secured "Psi-Scan of the
Year, Best Budget Model" three years running.

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,290
Now here are the results...

taking over, slowly but surely.

Remember how he used to be in the
early days? A gibbering wreck

91
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:37,533
completely unassertive, no self-confidence, plagued
by guilt, convinced he was fourth-rate?

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,217
- I really liked him then.
- Escape pod checked and standing by.

93
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,333
- Well, check it again.
- I've done three complete checks.

94
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,492
- It's ready to launch.
- Right, I'm going.

95
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,299
What really gets my goat, is the
way he thinks he can order me about.

96
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,250
Well, he who lives by the
rule book, dies by the rule book.

- Listy?

- I'm sorry, Lister, you're very faint.

102
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,534

some kind of mutated holo-plague

103

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,370

a double-lobotomy and 10 rolls of rubber wallpaper.

114

Holly, I really must be making tracks.
Keep me updated as to any further developments, will you?

115
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,895
Where is she?

116
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,449
I fear she's toying with us, sir.

117
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,569
- What kind of disease gives her hex vision?
- Clearly some kind of psi-virus, sir.

118
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,892
It appears to stimulate the dormant psychic areas of the brain,

119
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,257
which, until now, humankind
has been unable to harness.

120
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,175
Unfortunately, it requires so much energy,
it drains the victim's life-force.

121
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,143
That's why she
was in the stasis pod?

122
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,052
Precisely. Lanstrom was preserving
what little lifespan remains her.

123
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,293
Well, if she's running out of time, maybe we can just give her the run-around.

124
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,895
Theoretically, a sound notion, sir.
Unfortunately...

125
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,690
Unfortunately, she has already found you.

126
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,052
Twinkle, twinkle, little eye,

127
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,293
now it's time for you to die.

(WAILS IN AGONY)

129
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,810
Poor woman. Destroyed by her own genius.

130
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,291
- Genius?
- Oh, yes. From what little I've seen of her research,

131
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,339
before the holo-virus, she
had a quite remarkable mind.

132
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,494
If I'm right, the fruits of
her work should live on.

133
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,774
- Anything?
- Quite extraordinary.

134
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,218
Lanstrom postulated that there were
two kinds of virus - positive and negative.

135
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,577
- The negative we already know about.
- Yeah, like flu, rabies, that kind of stuff.

136
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,377
But she also believed that there were positive viral
strains which actually made human beings feel better.

137
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,637
Such as?

138
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,977
Well, at a very basic level,
she predicted a kind of reverse flu,

139
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,849
a strain of virus which promotes an unaccountable
feeling of well-being and happiness.

140
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,893
That's happened to me. My life's
been turned to complete and utter crud,

141
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,178
and I've woken up in the morning,
feeling good for no apparent reason.

142
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,500
The chances are, sir, that on those occasions you had
unwittingly contracted Lanstrom's virus.

143
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,291
According to her notes, 20th-century DJs
suffered from it all the time.

144
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,148
So what's in the tubes?

145
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:33,298
Lanstrom claims to have isolated
several strains of positive virus.

146
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,179
Inspiration, charisma, sexual magnetism...

147
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,977
Sexual magnetism's a virus?
Well, get me to hospital, I'm a terminal case!

148
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,778
This one is the most intriguing of all.
According to her notes,

149
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,497
this is the viral strain Felicitus populi,
commonly known as "luck."

150
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,055
- Luck is a virus?
- A positive virus,

151
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,179
which most humans contract at some point
in their lives for very short periods.

152
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,732
And here it is,
Lady Luck in liquid form. Want to try some?

153
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,856
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely harmless.

154
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,218
Even so, this is a minute dose
will only last for about three minutes.

155
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,296
Now, I want you to pick out all the aces
from this pack of cards.

156
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,020
- Shuffle 'em?
- Mm-hmm.

into that bullseye behind you

162
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,136
using your left hand, without looking.

163
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,487
- What, using my left hand?
- Hm-mmm.

164
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:45,725
- Into the bulls-eye?
- Hm-mmm.

165
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:46,770
- Without looking?
- Hm-mmm

166
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,931
- No chance.
- Trust me, sir.

167
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,556
- You ready?
- Hm-mmm!

168
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,276
(DULL THUD)

169
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,818
Ah. I think that indicates
the luck virus has worn off.

170
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,209
When you're quite finished, chaps. we've got
a bit of a problem with the cargo bay doors.

171
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,977
- What sort of problem?
- They won't open.

172
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,656
- Rimmer's put in an override.
- Welcome home, gentlemen.

173
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,575
If you'd like to proceed to the aft, you'll
find the landing lights on in Bay 47.

174
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,657
Bay 47? That's quarantine!

175
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,569
- Spot on.
- But, sir, I've screened us all. We're clean.

176
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,095
Well, much as I trust a viral screening
conducted by an automated toilet attendant,

177
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,131
I really must draw your attention
to Space Corps Directive 595.

178
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,890
- For cryin' out loud!
- I have no intention of contracting

179
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,416
the hologrammatic equivalent
of foaming dog fever.

180
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,096
So, gentlemen, if you'd all like to proceed to quarantine room 152,

181
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,537
where you will be spending
the next three months.

182
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,177
(DOOR HUMS)

183
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,095
12 weeks. I have a deep, dark
sense of foreboding about this.

184
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,689
Oh, come on. we'll get through it.

185
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,978
- This is single quarters. One chair, one bed, one shower.
- We'll manage.

186
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:17,099
Sir, it's a scientific fact that the
human male needs to spend time by himself.

187
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,620
- It is?
- Hmm.

188
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,330
The most popular pastimes have always
been ones that males can enjoy alone -

189
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,016
angling, golf
and, of course, the all-time number one.

190
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,289
It's not just humans. Look what happens when two male tigers are locked up together,

191
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,736
one of them winds up on the other guy's toothpick.

192
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,899
Lions, tigers, scorpions, rats...
even vultures when they're in captivity.

193
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,775
What are you saying to me?
Vultures need personal space?

194
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,060
They need, like, time alone to put their 
feet up and read "What Carcass?" magazine?

195
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,810
Sir, I think you're downplaying
the gravity of the situation.

196
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,412
Look, what difference does it make? We hang
out together most of the time anyway.

197
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,773
Yeah, but we all knew we could stroll
out the door at any time. Not now, though.

198
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,656
Welcome to quarantine, lads.
I hope the next 84 days pass as swiftly

199
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,209
and pleasantly as the 100 Years' War.

200
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,731
Sir, I must protest. You've only supplied
us with single-berth accommodation.

201
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,697
Space Corps Directive 597 clearly states
"one berth per registered crew member".

202
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,013
And as Listy is the only registered
crew member, one berth is all you get.

203
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,014
- Don't rise to him.
- What about entertainment?

204
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,178
You are obliged to provide us
with minimum leisure facilities.

205
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,611
Games, literature,
hobby activities, motion pictures.

206
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,576
And in accordance with Space Corps Directive 312,
you will find in the storage cupboard over there.

207
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,858
a chess set with 31 missing pieces,

208
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,298
a knitting magazine
with a pull-out special on crocheted hats,

209
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,532
a puzzle magazine
with all the crosswords completed

210
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,572
and a video of the excellent cinematic treat "Wallpapering,
Painting and Stippling - a DIY Guide".

211
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,906
Don't rise to him.

212
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,331
And fulfilling all Space
Corps dietary requirements,

213
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,494
dinner tonight, gentlemen,
will consist of sprout soup,

214
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,254
followed by sprout salad,

215
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,216
and for dessert - I think you'll like it,
rather unusual - sprout crumble.

216
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,936
Rimmer, you know damn well
sprouts make me chuck.

217
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,930
Well, this is awful. I've got you down
for sprouts almost every meal.

218
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,411
I tell a lie. It IS every meal.

219
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,612
- How long are you going to keep this up for, Rimmer?
- Keep what up?

220
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,216
I'm merely executing Space Corps Directive 595.

221
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,409
Anyway, must dasheroonie. I've got to organise
your daily provision of musical entertainment.

222
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,098
I think you're going to like it. It's a perpetually
looped tape of "Reggie Dixon's Tango Treats".

223
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,860
OK. Time to rise to him.
Let me at him! I'll kill him!

224
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,093
Listen guys, he wants us to get on each other's
nerves. Go through twelve weeks of hell.

225
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,774
Well, we're not going to give him the satisfaction.

226
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,094
OK, 'cause the entire time we're here, we're not gonna have
one single argument, not a raised voice, not a cross word,

227
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,730
not one angry exchange. OK? OK?

228
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,971
Boys from the Dwarf.

229
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,691
I think that's straight now. Two hours it's
taken me to panel-beat my head back into shape.

230
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,971
Two damn hours.

231
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,933
Guys, just take it easy.

232
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,212
If he tells me to 'take
it easy' one more time,

233
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:40,613
I swear, I'll turn his ears into a pair of
maracas and tap-dance a fandango on his throat.

234
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,656
I'm just saying there's 79 more days to go.

235
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,095
And if you want to be alive when there's only 78
more days to go, I suggest you do not blow your nose.

236
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,053
Do you mind if I ask why?

237
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,059
Well, let's forego the noise
and revolting burbling sound

238
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,009
and go straight to the really gross part,
when you always -

239
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,059
and I mean always - having blown your nose,

240
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,294
have to open up the handkerchief
and take a look at the contents.

241
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,216
I mean, why?
What do you expect to see in there?

242
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,650
A Turner seascape, perhaps?

243
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,735
The face of the Madonna?
An undiscovered Shakespearean sonnet?

244
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,251
Rimmer was right about you. You have changed.

245
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,572
- You're getting tetchy.
- Oh no, now don't call me tetchy.

246
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,811
You know what happens
when you call me tetchy.

247
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,098
Well, I'm calling you it now! That's exactly what I'm calling you.

248
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,252
Tetchy. Tetchy. Tetchy!

249
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,738
Just as well I can't hear you. It's just as
well as I can't hear you calling me tetchy.

250
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,211
You know what happens
when you call me tetchy.

251
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,416
Oh, no! Oh no, didn't I tell you?
Didn't I warn you what would happen?

252
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,408
- No.
- Yes.

253
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:58,676
- No!
- I'm putting it on.

254
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,156
- Don't put it on.
- I'm putting it on.

255
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,236
- He's putting it on.
- Here I go.

256
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,412
- There he goes.
- Kryten, if you put that on, I'm not gonna help you out. I'm not helping you again.

257
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,140
- Not this time.
- You think I need your help?

258
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,612
You think I can't extract my own head
from the waste disposal unit?

259
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,676
It won't be the waste disposal, Frankenstein.

260
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,089
This time, I'm gonna unscrew your neck-bolts and microwave your head.

261
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,531
Frankenstein was the creator,
not the monster.

262
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,170
It's a common misconception,
held by all truly stupid people.

263
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,894
Don't correct me. You know
how much I hate being corrected.

264
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,179
- It really gets my feckles up.
- It's "hackles", you moron. It really gets your hackles up.

265
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,651
- There's no such word as "feckles".
- Feckles, heckles, hackles, schmeckles.

266
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,209
Whatever the hell they are, they're up right
now, and pointing at you, buddy!

267
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,443
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

268
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:43,580
Guys! Guys! Look at us, what's
happened to us? Five days on a sprout diet

269
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,530
with a wallpapering video and a crochet
magazine and we've all turned into crazies.

270
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,649
Just don't call me tetchy, and don't blow your nose.

271
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,970
- And don't play that video, and don't correct me.
- OK.

272
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,218
- OK.
- OK. We're going to get through this.

273
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,372
(BOTH) Don't say we're going to get through this!

274
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,538
That stupid chirpy optimism.
That inane winsome grin.

275
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,689
This is insane! We've been here five days.

276
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,331
- There's no sign of any virus. We're clean.
- That's it! Five days. We've got him.

277
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,970
Space Corps Directive 699,
We can demand a rescreening.

278
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,317
He'll refuse.

279
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:21,777
He can't. He's playing it by
the book. We've nailed him...

280
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,615
(RIMMER, IMPASSIVELY) Gentlemen... your
conversation makes interesting listening.

281
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,169
 - Rimmer, is that you?
- Oh, yes.

282
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,857
- How long have you been listening?
- Two, maybe three hours.

283
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,289
- Well, no one's got any disease, man.
- We're clean.

284
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,657
You have to re-screen us, sir, as per Directive 699.

285
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,700
No one's got any virus
and no one's smeggin' nuts.

286
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,016
Well, that's good.

287
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,892
- Is something amiss?
- Amiss? God no, what could possibly be amiss?

288
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,216
You don't think there's anything amiss?

289
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,214
I'm sitting here wearing a red and white
checked gingham dress...

290
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,010
and army boots...
and you think that's un-amiss?

291
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,293
No, of course not. It's just we'd thought you'd gone nuts.
We were trying to humour you.

292
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,650
I was just doing a little test.
A little test to see if you had gone crazy.

293
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,494
(HOWLS INSANELY)

294
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,978
If there is one thing
I can't stand... it's crazy people.

295
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,850
Well, we've passed the test,
Rimmer. You can... let us out.

296
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,176
- I can't let you out.
- Why not?

297
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,260
Because the King of the Potato People won't let me.

298
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,291
I begged him.
I got down on my knees and wept.

299
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,971
He wants to keep you here...

300
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,210
...keep you here for ten years.

301
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,371
Could we see him?

302
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,212
- See who?
- The King.

303
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,775
- Do you have a magic carpet?
- Yeah, a little three-seater.

304
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,849
So, let me get this straight.

305
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,059
You want to fly on a magic carpet
to see the King of the Potato People...

306
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,975
...and plead with him for your freedom,
and you're telling me you're completely sane?

307
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:16,370
I think that warrants two hours... of W.O.O.

308
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,936
- What's W.O.O.?
- You had to ask.

309
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,299
With... out... oxygen.

310
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,614
No oxygen for two hours.

311
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,579
That'll teach you to be bread baskets.

312
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,214
- What do we do?
- I think our only hope's the Potato King.

313
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,931
- How the hell did he get the holo-virus?
- It can be transmitted over radio waves.

314
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,013
He must have spoken
to Lanstrom at some point.

315
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,578
I predict we have at least seven minutes
before the air in here becomes unbreathable.

316
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,533
- We gotta get out of here somehow.
- It's impossible.

317
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,615
That's the whole point of quarantine.
Nothing gets out. Nothing gets in.

318
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,579
Not even a microbe.

319
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,972
Kryten, any chance of you
cracking the code on the door lock?

320
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,811
The chances of punching in the correct
combination are literally billions to one.

321
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,693
- Unless...
- Of course!

322
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,971
The luck virus!

323
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,528
You really think that that
stuff can get us out of here?

324
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:22,489
If I give Mr Lister a suitably large dose, he will
temporarily become the luckiest human being who ever lived.

325
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,978
- OK then, what do I do?
- Well, you just press in whatever numbers you think are best.

326
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,693
OK.

327
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,256
Last digit, sir.

328
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,547
So what now?

329
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:47,470
We head for the hologram
projection suite, before Mr Rimmer...

330
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,099
Before Mr Rimmer what?

331
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,659
They've been naughty boys,
haven't they, Mr Flibble?

332
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,693
(CROAKS) Yes.

333
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,296
What happens to naughty boys
who've been naughty, Mr Flibble?

334
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,419
Uncle Arnie fries them alive
with his hex vision.

335
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,174
That's right, Mr Flibble.

336
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,731
This way!

337
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,135
The holo-virus is in its secondary stage.

338
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,533
- Mr Rimmer can't have long to live.
- What is he capable of?

339
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,459
Well, we've seen hex vision.
Almost certainly like Lanstrom,

340
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,976
he'll be capable of telepathy, and possibly even telekinesis.

341
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,177
Telekiny-what-a noose??

342
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,897
The ability to move objects
purely by the power of the mind.

343
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,354
Kryten, man, are you OK?

344
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:50,332
I have a medium-sized
fireaxe buried in my spinal column

345
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,810

Mr Flibble's very cross.

355

You shouldn't have ran away from him.

356
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,614
What are we going to do
with them, Mr Flibble?

357
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,060
We can't possibly do that.

358
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,010
Who'd clear up the mess?

359
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,693
- We need to use your luck, sir.
- How?

360
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,138
What we really need is some kind of remote link
to the hologram disk projection system.

- Like this one?
- What a stroke of luck.

362
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,333
Now all we need is a detachable
power transfer adapter

363

of up to five million volts.
