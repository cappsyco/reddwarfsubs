00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,760
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,775
(BOOMING VOICE) Thomas Allman.

3
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:50,980
Thomas Allman, you have been found
unworthy of having existed.

4
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,140
Is that you, mother?

5
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:58,378
Your life and all memory of you
will be wiped from history.

6
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:02,495
The void you occupied
in the space-time continuum

7
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:07,571
will be allocated to a person
who was never given the gift of life.

8
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,699
May they spend their time more wisely.

9
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,420
(WHOOSH)

10
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:16,176
No, please. Why me? There must be others
who've lived worthless lives.

11
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,134
All will be judged.

12
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,820
It is complete. All that remains
is to delete your physical form.

13
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:35,378
Sorry to disturb you, sir. Reality control.

14
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,973
Coffee, sir.
Double caffeinated, quadruple sugar.

15
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,815
- Nice one.
- Ah, Virgil's "Aeneid".

16
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:55,372
Oh, the epic tale
of Agamemnon's pursuit of Helen of Troy,

17
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,250
the most classic work by the greatest
Latin poet who ever put quill to parchment.

18
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,340
- Yeah, it's the comic book version.
- Oh, really?

19
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,936
It's good, man. Absolutely full of history.

20
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:10,580
"Zap! Pow! Ker-splat! Die in bed,
you Trojan pig-dog! Gnargh! Ker-pow!"

21
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,617
I see they've remained
faithful to the original text.

22
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,057
I'm sure Virgil would
have approved.

23
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:21,212
Kryten, don't discourage him. It's the only thing
he's ever read that doesn't have lift-up flaps.

24
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:26,175
I dunno though. This Wooden Horse of Troy malarkey,
I'm not buyin' that.

25
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:28,657
It's one of the most famous
military manoeuvres in history.

26
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,740
I mean, The Greeks have been camped outside Troy,

27
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,531
ker-powing, zapping and ker-splatting the Trojans for the best part of a decade, yeah?

28
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:36,617
So?

29
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,291
So all of a sudden they wake up
one morning, and the Greeks have gone.

30
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,419
And there outside the city walls, they've left this gift,

31
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,540
this tribute to their valiant foes,
a huge wooden horse,

32
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:51,172
just large enough to happily contain
500 Greeks in full battle dress

33
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,732
and still leave adequate room
for toilet facilities?

34
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:59,020
Are you telling me that not one Trojan goes,
"Hang on a minute, isn't that a bit of a funny pressie?"

35
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,378
What's wrong with a couple of hundred pairs of socks and some aftershave?

36
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:07,132
No, they don't, they just wheel it in
and all decide to go for an early night.

37
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,534
People that stupid deserve to be ker-powed,
zapped and ker-splatted in their beds.

38
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,651
You know what
the big joke is?

39
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:18,018
From this particular phase in history, we derive
the phrase: Beware of Greeks bearing gifts",

40
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:23,494
when it would be much more logical to derive the phrase:
"Beware of Trojans, they're complete smegheads."

41
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,774
Well, thank you, AJP Taylor.

42
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,211
- (THUD)
- What was that?

43
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,891
- That's strange. We've changed course.
- Are you sure, Holly?

44
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,471
There's no course
change programmed.

45
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:36,774
(THUD) And again.

46
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:40,051
(ALARM SOUNDS)
Mark one eight zero, that's a complete turn.

47
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,940
- We're heading back to Red Dwarf.
- Give me manual, Hol.

48
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,092
- Agh!
- We're locked out!

49
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:48,023
This is not a malfunction, there is
something's controlling the craft.

50
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,300
Holly, any traffic around?

51
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,141
- Nothing on the local scan.
- This is impossible, there must be...

52
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:57,211
(BOOMING VOICE) I am in possession
of the human known as Lister. Do not attempt to resist me.

53
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,301
What happened to him?
His voice finally break?

54
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:06,337
- Who are you?
- Tremble at my name, for I am the Inquisitor.

55
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,057
- The Inquisitor?
- Your vessel is under my control.

56
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:14,215
it will return you to your mothership
where you will face judgement.

57
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,460
You will each present a case
to justify your existence.

58
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:22,137
If you fail, you will be deleted.

59
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,432
Are you OK, sir?

60
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:28,947
Yeah. God, I think so.
A little bit shaky.

61
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:32,253
I think we should run you through the
medi-scan though, just as a precaution.

62
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,412
Yeah, OK.

63
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:42,815
So, Kryten, you've heard of this Inquisitor?

64
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:47,492
Only as a myth, a dark fable, a horror tale,

65
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,813
told across the flickering embers
of a midnight fire

66
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:55,618
wherever hardened space dogs gather
to drink fermented vegetable products

67
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:59,530
and compete in tales of blood-chilling terror.

68
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,981
A simple "yes" would have sufficed.

69
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,971
- So who is he?
- Yeah, what's his beef?

70
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,651
Well, the legend tells of a droid,
a self-repairing simulant,

71
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:14,258
who survives till the end of eternity,
to the end of time itself.

72
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:19,860
After millions of years alone, he finally
reaches the conclusion that there is no God,

73
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:24,936
no afterlife, and the only purpose
of existence is to lead a worthwhile life.

74
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,860
And so the droid constructs a time machine

75
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:32,891
and roams eternity, visiting every single
soul in history and assessing each one.

76
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,701
 He erases all those who wasted their lives

77
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,571
and replaces them with those that never had
a chance of life, the unfertilised eggs,

78
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,971
the sperms that never made it.

79
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:46,213
That is the Inquisitor.
He prunes away the wastrels,

80
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,850
expunges the wretched
and deletes the worthless.

81
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,052
We're in big trouble.

82
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,457
Wait a minute, who's to say what's worthless?

83
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:58,132
Oh, please! Look in the mirror.
Read your entry in "Who's Nobody".

84
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,577
No, I mean it. Whose to judge?
Who's to say what's worthwhile?

85
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,899
Well, let's face it Listy, Lying
on your bunk reading "What Bike"

86
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:10,851
and eating Sugar Puff sandwiches for eight
hours every day is unlikely to qualify.

87
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,975
So because I haven't written any symphonies
or painted the Sistine Chapel, that makes me prunable?

88
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:19,334
No, being a totally worthless, unwashed
space bum, that's what makes you prunable.

89
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:24,980
Precisely. The criterion is not fame,
it is simply to have lived a worthwhile life.

90
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:29,618
Why did no one mention this before?

91
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,854
If I'd been told about this at the start that
the object was to lead a worthwhile life,

92
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,410
I could have done something about it.

93
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,734
All those charity telethons when I
used to ring in and pledge donations,

94
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,576
If I'd have known all this, I would
have given them MY credit card number.

95
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:53,141
Sir, you don't have to be a great philanthropist, or a
missionary worker, you simply have to seize the gift of life...

96
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,292
- Oh, God.
- ...make a contribution...

97
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,577
- Oh, God.
- ...no matter how small.

98
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:02,690
You simply have to have lead a life that
wasn't totally egocentric, vain and self-serving.

99
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,972
You're doing this on purpose aren't you?

100
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,537
- Well, I'm just trying to make you feel better, sir
- Well, shut up, then!

101
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:13,539
Hang on a minute. Why should we take
any notice of some half-crazed rogue robot

102
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,534
who's appointed himself judge
and jury to the whole of humanity?

103
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,011
Why should we kowtow to his judgement?

104
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:23,812
Because I have the power
to snap your body in two like a dry reed!

105
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,972
Good answer, man. Good answer!

106
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:39,741
- So where is he?
- See me now and tremble!

107
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:46,534
The inquisition begins. Prove to me
you are worthy of the honour of life

108
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:51,332
or drink deeply from the well
of nothingness for all eternity.

109
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,101
I hate these "either/or" questions.

110
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,258
Who is to be first?

111
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,773
Lister!

112
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,700
The hologram. You shall be first.

113
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,290
(SQUEAKS) Pardon? Sorry.

114
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:13,493
You have been granted
the greatest gift of all - the gift of life.

115
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:20,931
Tell me, what you have done
to deserve this superlative good fortune?

116
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:25,890
Well, I say this with the highest respect,

117
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,656
but what gives you the right to ask -

118
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:34,895
no, actually, demand -
that answer of me, Your Magnificence?

119
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:39,896
All must answer to the Inquisitor!

120
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:43,379
How do I know I'll get a fair hearing?

121
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:51,130
Because, like all who stand
before the Inquisitor, your judge shall be...

122
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,737
(CHEERILY) ...yourself!

123
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,500
- Oh, smeg.
- "Oh, smeg" indeed, matey.

124
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,698
Everyone is judged by their own self?

125
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:05,974
It's a bit metaphysical, I know,
but it's the only fair way.

126
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,132
Now, then. Justify yourself.

127
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,375
Well, first I...

128
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,221
- Liar.
- I've done good things.

129
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:17,540
- No, you haven't.
- In my heart, I've always tried to do good things.

130
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:22,019
- No, you didn't.
- Look, in my way, I've tried to lead a good life.

131
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,019
When?

132
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:28,494
Ah! What's that in the corner? It's the Archangel Gabriel!

133
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:31,301
Well, that's me converted, I'm a new man, Hallelujah!

134
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:37,055
You are a slimy, despicable, rat-hearted,
green discharge of a man, aren't you?

135
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,332
Well... sort of, yes.

136
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,374
So, then, justify yourself.

137
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,697
What else could I have been?

138
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:50,731
My father was a half-crazed military failure,
my mother was a bitch-queen from hell.

139
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:54,292
My brothers had all the looks and talent.
And what did I have?

140
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,340
Unmanageable hair and ingrowing toenails.

141
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,617
Yes, I admit I'm nothing.

142
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:03,456
But from what I started with, nothing is up.

143
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,859
Hi, buddy.

144
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:13,178
This is your judgement day, bud.
I gotta be cruel. There can't be no favours.

145
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,452
I'm hearing you on FM.

146
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:19,894
I have to ask you the question:
justify your existence.

147
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:22,098
What contribution have you made?

148
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:27,501
I have given pleasure to the world
because I have such a beautiful ass.

149
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,341
- Well, that's true.
- Can I go now?

150
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,294
- That's your case?
- You need more?!

151
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,856
Some might say that's a pretty shallow argument.

152
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,371
Some might say I'm a pretty shallow guy.

153
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,612
But a shallow guy with a great ass.

154
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:43,893
- Sometimes you astonish even me.
- Thank you.

155
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,661
Well, Kryten, justify yourself.

156
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,499
I'm not sure I can.

157
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,534
But, surely your life is replete with good works.

158
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:58,410
There can be few individuals who
have lived a more selfless life.

159
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:03,934
But I am programmed to live unselfishly, and therefore
any good works I do come not out of fine motives,

160
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:08,299
but as a result of a series of binary
commands I am compelled to obey.

161
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,334
well, then, how can any
mechanical justify himself?

162
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,294
Perhaps only if he attempted to break his programming

163
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,250
and conduct his life according to a set
of values he arrived at independently.

164
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,532
Your argument invites deletion.

165
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:24,097
- The rules are yours, not mine.
- Do you wish to be erased?

166
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:27,419
Well, I am programmed
not to wish for anything. I serve.

167
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,057
In a human, this behaviour
might be considered stubborn.

168
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:34,299
But I am not human, and neither are you.

169
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,499
And it is not our place to judge them.

170
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:39,811
I wonder why you do?

171
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,130
(BOOMING VOICE) Enough.

172
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:48,018
Well... get out of this one, smeghead.

173
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:50,962
What you talkin' about?

174
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:55,107
You know what you could've made of your life
it you tried - what you could've become.

175
00:11:55,131 --> 00:12:00,412
- So?
- You've got brains, man. Brains you've never used.

176
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:04,216
- So?
- So justify yourself.

177
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,458
Spin on it!

178
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,491
The inquisition is over.

179
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,770
I have reached my verdict.

180
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:21,175
Two of you have failed to become
that which you might so easily have been.

181
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,892
You have lived without merit,
and so have not lived at all

182
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,217
(WHOOSH)

183
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,975
- You scum! You've wiped them out!
- Sir...

184
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,815
He's crazy, Kryten.
He's erased the Cat and Rimmer.

185
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,298
- They are quite safe.
- Sir...

186
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:41,101
I'm afraid it is we are to be erased.

187
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,581
Ah.

188
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,093
The Cat has lead a more worthwhile
life than either of us?

189
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,340
He is a shallow and selfish creature,
as is the hologram.

190
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:55,971
By their own low standards,
they have acquitted themselves.

191
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:01,420
Whereas you and the mechanoid
could have been so much more.

192
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,180
(WHOOSH)

193
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:08,653
- What's this?
- Best guess, we are being surgically removed from time.

194
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:14,214
Every memory of us, every action we ever performed
is being dissolved. Our lives are being undone.

195
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:19,097
It is complete. The time-lines are knitted.
Causality is healed.

196
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:24,131
All that remains is to remove
your physical forms from existence.

197
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:28,181
Well, if you've got some amazing secret plan
up your sleeve, Kryten,

198
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,810
now's the time to mention it.

199
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,699
No plan, sir.

200
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,898
No sleeves.

201
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,453
- (WHOOSH)
- Perfect. Ah, now, what did I do next?

202
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,532

00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,539
(INQUISITOR WAILS)

204
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:46,818
Now, hurry! Take the gauntlet and go!

205
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:50,139
- What the smeg is goin' on?
- I don't have time to explain.

206
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:53,293
I've come from the future
to rescue you. Now you must go, hurry!

207
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,581
What about me... I mean you... I mean us?

208
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:00,376
- I'm afraid we get killed.
- Killed? How?

209
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:05,815
While I'm standing here explaining this to you
the Inquisitor jumps me from behind like this...

210
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,895
You can't save me. Before you reach
the final confrontation in the storage bay,

211
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,621
you must have decoded the gauntlet's controls.

212
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:16,012
- How? Can you give us a clue?
- Well, I cannot explain.

213
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:19,458
For some bizarre reason, my final words are "enig".

214
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:23,174
- "Enig"?
- Yes. Enig...

215
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,176
- Come on, sir we have to go.
- He's just killed you, Kryten!

- How do you know my name?
- Don't fall for that one, bud. He read it on your uniform.

231
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,771
Sir, they've never met us before.
We are limbo people between realities.

232
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,279
They have no memory of us.

233
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:45,458
So, I'm going to ask you one
more time. What do you want?

234
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:51,498
Yo, we're not the enemy. There's a guy round here somewhere,
wandering around obliterating people from history.

235
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,370
- We used to be your shipmates.
- Only we've forgotten you (!)

236
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,388
Yeah.

237
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,858
Well, I don't know about
you but I'm convinced (!)

238
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,933
- Rimmer, I know you.
- Well, if you do know me,

239
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:09,131
you'll know I'm a kind of rough-and-tumble, hardened astro
ex-marine type guy you do not trifle with.

240
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:11,652
No, you're not!

241
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:14,734
- For the last time of asking-
- Fiona Barrington.

242
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:18,781
Fifteen years of age. You got off with her
in your Dad's greenhouse.

243
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:25,017
You thought you got lucky but it turned out all the time
that you had your hand in warm compost.

244
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:28,492
- How could I know that, and not know you?
- Not true.

245
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,809
You got three brothers, John, Howard
and Frank. You're really mean with money.

246
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:37,642
You're a tremendous physical coward. You once
spent an afternoon on a Samaritans switchboard,

247
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,610
and four people
committed suicide.

248
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:42,290
Your middle name's Judas, but you tell everyone that it's Jonathan.

249
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,852
You sign all your official letters 'A. J. Rimmer, BSc'.

250
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:49,218
and BSc stands for Bronze Swimming Certificate.

251
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:52,220
You're a cheating, weaselly, lowlife scumbucket

252
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:56,659
with all the charm
and social grace of a pubic louse.

253
00:16:56,861 --> 00:17:00,616
You gotta admit, bud.
He's got a handle on you there.

254
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,857
Sirs, you've got to help us. The Inquisitor
will stop at nothing to obliterate us.

255
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:10,098
Who the smeg are these guys, Rimmer?

256
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,134
Never mind 'Who the smeg are these guys'... Who the smeg are you?

257
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:15,412
I, the smeg, am Lister.

258
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:21,094
Of course. He's the alternative you. One of the
many David Listers who never got a chance to exist.

259
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,981
So we're kind of... sperms-in-law?

260
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,457
- Yes, sir.
- Delicately put, sir.

261
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,050
- So what do we do with them?
- I say, waste them.

262
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,457
(LISTERS) Rimmer, for smeg's sake!

263
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,657
- He's such a dork, man.
- You're tellin' me?

264
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,224
Look, they've come here
with some cock-and-bull story,

265
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:41,015
they're chained together like
Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.

266
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,855
I say open the door to oblivion and kick 'em through.

267
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:46,974
- Rimmer, no one's killing no one, alright?
- Yeah, right.

268
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,175
Look, they've come from some freaky alternative
dimension, they've come here to hijack this ship

269
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:54,015
and do... ooh, weird things to us.

270
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:57,378
I think we should take the lift, put them on the Security Deck and stick them in the brig.

271
00:17:57,581 --> 00:18:01,540
I hate to say it, but for once
TransAm wheel arch nostrils is right.

272
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:03,897
- Get moving.
- What did you call me?

273
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,417
- Look, man, you know the score.
- Why do I know the score?

274
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:13,176
Because you're me.
We're shot from the same gun barrel.

275
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:17,130
Only difference is,
one did breast stroke, one did crawl.

276
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:19,417
What are you trying to say?

277
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,295
- I'm saying...
- (CRASH)

278
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,657
That's him, guys!

279
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,417
This way!

280
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,379
- Come on! Let's go!
- Let's go back! Let's go back!

281
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,815
Oh, my God! Hang on a minute.
I can use this. Come on! Go!

282
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,851
If we got down to the transport decks, maybe we
could nick one of the Starbugs, and get outta town.

283
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,331
Uh-oh. A door. We'd better use an air vent.

284
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:01,219
- No need.
- Sir?

285
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,470
Look, I'm gonna do something
now, Kryten, that's totally, totally gross

286
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:04,772
and I don't want you
to look. Turn around.

287
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:07,615
- What?
- Trust me, you don't wanna know.

288
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,291
(BLEEPS AND HUMS)

289
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,974
Logically, sir, there is only one way you
could possibly have opened that door.

290
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,451
I feel quite nauseous.

291
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,817
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

292
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:30,212
Oh, sir, you've got it in your jacket!

293
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:36,252
- I got us out of a hole, didn't I?
- Oh, sir, you are sick! You are a sick, sick person.

294
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:42,258
- How can you possibly even conceive of such an idea?
- Shut up or I'll beat you to death with the wet end!

295
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:46,096
Sir, if mechanoids could barf,
I'd be onto my fifth bag by now.

296
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,332
- You're a sick person! Sick! Sick!
- Come on Kryten. Let's go! Come on!

297
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:58,698
What's the point? Why am I trying
to get out of this? We already know we fail.

298
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,415
Not so, sir. All we know is that I die.

299
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,218
Now, if my small gambit ultimately results in
your safety, then it will be a move well made.

300
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,458
For myself, death holds no fear.

301
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:12,370
- Oh, yeah?
- Sir, I am programmed to relinquish my life.

302
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:18,059
That's why the Mechanoid 4000 Series was voted
"Android of the Year" five years running.

303
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:22,931
I have as much interest in saving my own life
as a chronically depressed lemming.

304
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:25,641
- That's not true, is it?
- Sir?

305
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,121
Not any more.

306
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:32,460
And it's all because of me. It's my fault.
Because I made you break your programming.

307
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,693
I taught you how to lie,
how to make your own decisions.

308
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,853
I made you more... more human.

309
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:43,052
I gave you a life to lose.

310
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:47,292
Sir, with the greatest respect,
that is complete and utter shash.

311
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,495
Kryten, I know when you're lying.
Your right foot jiggles.

312
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,540
- It's involuntary.
- Nonsense.

313
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,257
I'm not afraid to die.

314
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,492
For me, death holds no fear.

315
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,692
I believe in Silicon Heaven.

316
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,898
I believe in an afterlife for androids!

317
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,372
- Haven't you gotten through those damn manacles, yet?!
- KRYTEN!

318
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:16,298
- I'm not going to let it happen, man.
- Cause and effect, sir. It already HAS happened.

319
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:19,453
There's nothing we can do
except to try and save your life.

320
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:23,017
OK. Now, I think this is a variant
of the Enigma decoding system.

321
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,219
- Enigma. "Enig" - Enigma.
- "Enig". Of course.

322
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,054
My last words.

323
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:33,091
Well, anyway, if this thing works, it should age
those manacles by half a million years.

324
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:36,692
- And if it doesn't work?
- It'll wipe out the universe.

325
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,733
- Phew!
- What now?

326
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,017
Well, now WE have the power.

327
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:44,894
(CLUNK)

328
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,368
OK, we don't know who you are,

329
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:49,897
but we've seen enough of the other dudes
to know that we wanna be on your side.

330
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:52,337
He killed our two crew mates in cold blood. He's a monster.

331
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,693
- I'm the Cat, this is Rimmer.
- Yeah. Lister. Kryten.

332
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:59,386
Look, I want to make it clear. I'm not exactly in
love with the idea of pitching in with you two,

333
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,896
but needs must
as the devil drives.

334
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:05,857
You really don't remember me, do you?
How everything I used to do used to get on your pecs.

335
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:11,300
Like I'd just be trimming me toenails with your electric
meat carver or something, and you'd go absolutely spare.

336
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,254
Sir, we really must get down to the storage bay.

337
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:19,097
Now, remember my message to us. That is where we meet
the Inquisitor for the final confrontation.

338
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:21,861
That's your plan? We go out there and face him?

339
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:25,491
Nice plan (!)
Shall I paint a bull's-eye on my face?

340
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,773
Listen, Kryten. I've been thinking about this. I've come up with something.

341
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:32,093
- Yes, sir?
- I'm gonna use my brains for the first time in my life.

342
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:36,380
Considering the circumstances, sir,
do you really believe that's wise?

343
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,221
- Give me the time gauntlet.
- But you don't know how to use it, sir.

344
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:42,817
- You'll have to shout instructions, won't you?
- Wouldn't it be simpler if I wore it?

345
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,972
- You can't wear it, Kryten.
- Why not?

346
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:47,212
You're programmed not to kill.

347
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:59,819
So, the mortals seek to challenge my mastery.

348
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:02,336
(SWOOSH)

349
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,332
Kryten, I don't know how to work this thing.

350
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,731
Gamma, delta, one, four, five.

351
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:27,296
- Smeg. You youthed me.
- The sport begins.

352
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,697
(SWOOSH)

353
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,296
Now what the smeg have you done?

354
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,939
Excuse me. Could I just distract you for a brief second?

355
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,660
Huh?

356
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:43,421
(SWOOSH)

357
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:55,898
"Excuse me. Could I possibly just
distract you for just a brief second"?!

358
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:00,217
It was the best I could ad-lib at the time, sir.

359
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:05,297
- He got the Cat and Rimmer, though.
- I know.

360
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:09,420
Look, sir. I've got to go back in time
and sacrifice myself

361
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:14,018
in order that we can get into this
mess we're in now in the first place.

362
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,979
Yeah, sure.

363
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:20,291
All in all, today's been a
bit of a bummer hasn't it, sir.

364
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:25,098
- How long before he unfreezes? Ten minutes?
- No. 8.4,

365
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:30,497
- We'd better be right, Kryten.
- I know. Gauntlets.

366
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,217
Now, what do I say when I pop up
behind the Inquisitor?

367
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,643
Er, "Perfect. Ah,
now, what did I do-"

368
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:40,410
That's it. Yeah, that's it. I know. I've got it. Don't
tell me. Don't tell me. I've got it. I've got it.

369
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:47,653
OK, big fella. It's dangling time.

370
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:54,495
- Welcome back on-line.
- What are you doing?

371
00:24:54,661 --> 00:25:00,691
One way or the other, you killed
a lot of my friends this afternoon.

372
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:05,298
In fact, you may never
get on my good side again.

373
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:14,450
- Oops.
- So now you're going to kill me?

374
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:20,094
I don't think so. You're a fat little human
who doesn't have the balls.

375
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,091
Dumb talk for a guy
who's dangling over a chasm.

376
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:29,539
I've seen inside your heart.
You don't have it in you.

377
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:32,335
Oh, yeah?

378
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:35,292
Bet your life?

379
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:42,492
- I never intended to kill you.
- Oh, no?

380
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,011
No. I intended to save your life.

381
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,497
Save my life? Why?

382
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:57,290
'Cause if I save your life, and you erase me,

383
00:25:57,461 --> 00:26:00,533
I won't be there to save your life, and you'll die.

384
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:04,212
Chew on that, pal.

385
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:09,419
You're giving me my gauntlet back?

386
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,295
Well, I'm all right. You can't touch me.

387
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:16,694
You might've killed the others, but I'm OK.

388
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,258
Oh, just one thing.

389
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:27,341
If I erase you from history, you will never
have existed to threaten my life in the first place.

390
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:33,417
- That's a point.
- So, in fact, I can erase you quite safely.

391
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,174
Yeah.

392
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:42,294
Yeah! It's the old backfiring
time gauntlet trick.

393
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:46,290
You just bought yourself
a one-way ticket to oblivion.

394
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:50,620
But you can't! My work!
All my glorious work will be undone!

395
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:52,814
(WHOOSH)

396
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:55,621
- Oh, it worked!
- It worked?

397
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,734
- Kryten, you're a genius.
- It was your scheme, sir.

398
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,893
- I simply re-programmed the gauntlet.
- So what happens now?

399
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:03,699
(WHOOSH)

400
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:07,820
Well, basically we wait for the
time-space continuum to reorder itself.

401
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:10,376
(WHOOSH)

402
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:14,370
I believe this is an appropriate
juncture for you to give me five, sir.

403
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,619
Give you five? I can do better than that.

404
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:19,897
I can give you fifteen.

405
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,378
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

406
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:29,818
# I'm all alone, more or less

407
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,133
# Let me fly far away from here

408
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,895
# Fun, fun, fun

409
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,816
# In the sun, sun, sun

410
00:27:39,981 --> 00:27:43,212
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

411
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:46,578
# Drinking fresh mango juice

412
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,938
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

413
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,741
# Fun, fun, fun

414
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:56,576
# In the sun, sun, sun

415
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,176
# Fun, fun, fun

416
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:03,934
# In the sun, sun, sun #
