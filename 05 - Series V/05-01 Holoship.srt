("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,936
(MAN) Oh, Marnie.
(WOMAN) Oh, my darling, don't.

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,770
This isn't a time for sadness,
it's a time for joy, for laughter. Don't you see?

4
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,377
Whatever this crazy old world throws
at us now it doesn't matter. None of it does.

5
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,498
(MAN) Marnie, we can never be together again.

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,016
(WOMAN) Oh, darling, you're wrong.
we'll always be together.

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,490
It's just... we'll be apart.

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,971
Wasn't that just beautiful?
Oh, well recommended, sir.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,456
Do you think they ever get back together again?

10
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,129
- (SOBS) I don't know.
- Pardon?

11
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,132
(SQUEAKS) I don't know!

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,702
Wasn't it just
wonderful though, sir?

13
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:18,572
The way he sacrificed his career, his
dreams, everything for the woman he loved?

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,370
I thought it was the worst
pile of blubbery schoolgirl mush

15
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,617
I've ever been
compelled to endure.

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,298
I consider it an insult to my backside that
it was forced to sit here growing carbuncles

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,895
through such putrid adolescent slush.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,435
You didn't find it uplifting?

19
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,697
It wasn't in the least bit
uplifting. It was totally unbelievable.

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,852
Why would he give everything up for a
woman he's never going to see again?

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,452
Because she loved him, and he would
have that forever. Isn't that right, sir?

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,497
(BLOWS NOSE)

23
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,290
Personally, I thought it
started well but fell apart.

24
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:53,293
All the stuff with the ducks all
getting into trouble, that was great.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,293
Then it all went black and white and I fell asleep.

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,252
But, sir, that was the cartoon
before the main programme.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,377
Hang on, chaps.
We've got a blip. Quadrant 4, sector 492,

28
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,112
I'm onto it right away Holly.

29
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:12,908
Those kind of films really
irritate me. Just not realistic.

30
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,943
There isn't a man in the universe
who wouldn't have taken the job

31
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,987
and to hell with the
woman. Total baloney.

32
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,695
Rimmer, you said that about
"King of Kings: The Story of Jesus"

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,414
Well, it's true. A simple carpenter's son
who learns how to do magic tricks like that

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,094
and doesn't go into show business?

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,173
Do any of us believe that, even for a second?

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,107
He was supposed to
be the Son of God(!)

37
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,499
And when he was
carrying that cross up the hill

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,415
any normal, realistic bloke would've mule-kicked
the guy on the left, clobbered the one on the right

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,256
and been over that green hill and far away
before you could say 'Pontius Pilate'.

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,373
Why do I feel that somehow
you've missed the point?

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,535
I mean, whether you believe it or not, it's
about a dude who sacrifices his life for love.

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,731
Not realistic. As if!

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,409
You've got no soul, man. No soul.

44
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,016
- Sirs, I think you should take a look at this.
- Another vessel?

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,740
Too small. It may be a missile.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,530
- Impact in 37 seconds.
- Plotting random evasion course.

47
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,734
What?! Am I the only sane one here?
Why don't we drop the defensive shields?

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,859
A superlative suggestion, sir,
with just two minor flaws.

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,016
One, we don't have any defensive shields,
and two, we don't have any defensive shields.

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,740
Now, I realise that technically speaking,
that's only one flaw,

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,212
but I thought it was such a big one,
it was worth mentioning twice.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,178
Good point. Well made.

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,053
(WHOOSH)

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,051
Rimmer, what are you doing?

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,212
It's incredible! It's beautiful!

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,856
It's not registering on any scale.
Mass, velocity, molecular structure -

57
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,011
all the readings are zero.

58
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,336
Sir, I'm picking up
some kind of energy emission.

59
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,855
They've taken Mr Rimmer!
Sir, they've taken Mr. Rimmer!

60
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,054
Quick! Let's get out of here
before they bring him back!

61
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,576
I hope we didn't startle you. Nirvanah Crane.

62
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,057
You touched me. I can touch.

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,255
- How is this possible?
- This entire ship, its crew

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,536
and everything on it is computer-generated.

65
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,778
- You're all holograms? Even the ship?
- Salut.

66
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,379
Salut.

67
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,498
- How big's the crew?
- Just under 2,000. All top-flight personnel.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,415
- Hmm. What a ship.
- (COMPUTER) Floor 3125,

69
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,969
Sports and sexual recreation.

70
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,291
- Sports and what?
- Sex.

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,095
- Don't you have a sex deck on your ship?
- No.

72
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,516
Well, what do you do
when you want to have sex?

73
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,617
Well, we go for runs.

74
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,294
Watch gardening programmes on the ship's vid.

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,255
That's very bad for you.
Don't you ever feel tense or frustrated?

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,294
Well, it's gotten worse
these last ten years or so, I can't deny it.

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,491
Extraordinary. It's quite different here.

78
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,860
In fact, it's a ship regulation that we all have sexual
congress at least twice a day. It's a health rule.

79
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,894
Twice a day?! That's more than
some people manage in a lifetime!

80
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,334
I mean sad, lonely people.
But what happens if you don't have a partner?

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,577
If you don't have a partner?

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,818
Well, some people - sad, lonely people -

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,814
find that that people just aren't
attracted to them in that kind of way.

84
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,220
I don't understand. Here it is considered the height
of bad manners to refuse an offer of sexual coupling.

85
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,492
Well...

86
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,857
People have always complimented me
on my good manners.

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,459
What a ship!

88
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,170
We discarded the concept of "family"
in the 25th century,

89
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,618
when scientists finally proved that all our hang-ups
and neuroses are caused by our parents.

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,176
- I knew it.
- Families are disastrous for your mental health.

91
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,379
So are relationships.
These are outmoded concepts for us.

92
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,538
But what about love? Surely people still fall in love?

93
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,970
We have developed beyond love, Mr. Rimmer.

94
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,416
That is a short-term hormonal distraction

95
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,732
which interferes with the pure pursuit
of personal advancement.

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,780
We are holograms.
There is no risk of disease or pregnancy.

97
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,729
That is why in our society,
we only believe in sex...

98
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,211
constant, guilt-free sex.

99
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,410
Poor Mr Rimmer. I fear he is in great danger.

100
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,409
I'm trying to get them to handshake,
but they're not responding on any frequency.

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,250
Well, I say let's break out the laser cannons
and give 'em both barrels.

102
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,776
An adroit suggestion, sir,
with just two minor drawbacks...

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,738
OK! Forget it!

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,138
There's nothing to shoot at.
Look at the readouts. Zero mass.

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,810
- Of course! A holoship.
- A holoship?

106
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,331
The project was in its initial phase
when I left the solar system.

107
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,813
Ships of no mass or volume,
able to travel as super-light particles -

108
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,779
tachyons - through wormholes and stargates,

109
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,137
crewed by holograms
of great genius and bravery.

110
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,049
And they've taken Rimmer?
He should fit in just perfectly.

111
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,013
Now I understand why they
didn't bother with a handshake.

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,217
Holocrews are legendarily arrogant.

113
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,453
They despise stupidity wherever they see it,
and they see it everywhere.

114
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,731
Hang on, I'm getting another energy emission.

115
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,930
Binks to Enlightenment. Have arrived
on the derelict. Confirm initial speculation.

116
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,616
There is absolutely nothing
of any value or interest here.

117
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,533
It's one of the old Class 2 ship-to-surface vessels,

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,092
the very model, in fact, that was
withdrawn due to major flight design flaws.

119
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,896
Crew, three. One Series 4000 mechanoid -
almost burnt out.

120
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,735
Give it maybe three years.
Nothing of salvageable value.

121
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,930
Ah, Felis sapiens, bred from the domestic
house cat and about half as smart.

122
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,570
No value in future study of this species.

123
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,177
What have we here? A human being,
or a very close approximation.

124
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,970
Chronological age, mid-20s.
Physical age, 47.

125
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,935
Grossly overweight, unnecessarily ugly,
otherwise would recommend it for the museum.

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,853
Apart from that. Of no value or interest.

127
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,857

We have in our midst a complete smeg-pot.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,293
Brains in the anal region.
Chin absent, presumed missing.

129
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,858
Genitalia small and inoffensive,
of no value or interest.

130
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,099
Binks to Enlightenment.
Evidence of primitive humour.

131
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,094
The human has knowledge of irony,
satire and imitation.

132
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,009
With patient tuition
could maybe master simple tasks.

133
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,169
Lister to Red Dwarf.
Displays evidence of spoiling for a rumble.

134
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,293
Seems unable to grasp simple threats.

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,859
With careful pummelling, could possibly be
sucking tomorrow's lunch through a straw.

136
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,813
Binks to Enlightenment.
The human is under the delusion

137
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,099
that he is somehow able
to bestow physical violence to a hologram.

138
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,249
Lister to Red Dwarf.
The intruder seems to be blissfully unaware

139
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,290
that we have a rather sturdy holowhip
in the munitions cabinet,

140
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,733
and unless he wants his derriére
minced like burger meat,

141
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,170
he'd better be history in two seconds flat.

Recon mission complete, transmit.

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,014
With speed, Enlightenment. Quickly, please!

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,100
Captain, Mr Rimmer
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

145
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,089
Mr Rimmer. Oh, my word. It is
one of the old Class 1 holograms

146
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,016
I didn't realise you guys were
still around. Captain Hercule Platini,

147
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,535
IQ 212. Number One.

148
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,940

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,172
Second Technician Arnold Rimmer, IQ unknown.

151
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,732
- Captain, this is a magnificent ship.
- So it should be, Mr Rimmer.

152
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,690
After all, it was designed to carry the
hologrammatic cream of the Space Corps.

153
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,216
Every crew member is the top gun in his or her field.

154
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,135
This is a ship, Mr Rimmer, of superhumans.

155
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,976
Which is why, Captain,
I feel I could really belong here.

156
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,371
Are you serious?

157
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,934
Everything I want in my life
is here on this ship. I want to join you.

158
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,575
Ah, but Mr Rimmer,
you are not an officer.

159
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,853
Captain, I've been in effective command
of Red Dwarf now for nearly four years.

160
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,140
I've guided that ragamuffin, ragtail crew of whacked-out
crazies and hippy peaceniks through hell and back.

161
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,293
If I gave the order, those guys would crawl on their
bellies across broken glass with their flies unzipped.

162
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,451
So don't tell me I'm not an officer, Captain,

163
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,739
just because in deep space,
there's no academy around to award me my pips.

164
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,291
- You've got to take me.
- Unfortunately, it's not that simple, Mr Rimmer.

165
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,020
The Enlightenment already has a full ship's complement.

166
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,298
The only way in is "Dead Man's Boots".

167
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,094
You'll have to challenge an existing crew member.

168
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,254
There are tests
which tax the entire vista of your intellect.

169
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,733
Oh.

170
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,451
Tests that probe every aspect
of your mental capability.

171
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,094
Ah.

172
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,770
Should you win, your opponent's run time
would be terminated

173
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,171
and their life-force would be used
to generate you.

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,330
Who will be my opponent?

175
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,016
Well, I'm sure our computer will come up
with the most stimulating match-up.

176
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,535
It has stochastic capabilities.

177
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,937
It predicts the future
with only a 5% error margin,

178
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,173
simply by extrapolating the most likely
outcome of all known variables.

179
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,776
I am asking it
for your best chance of success.

180
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,696
And here it is.
Your best shot is crew member 4172.

181
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,979
You have a 96% probability of failure.

182
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,812
Mr Rimmer, you have 24 hours to prepare.

183
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,098
Well, thank you, Commander,
for a most fascinating afternoon.

184
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,820
It's been most... fascinating.

185
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,329
Perhaps, if you're not in any great rush, Mr Rimmer, we
could retire to my quarters and have sex for a few hours.

186
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,769
That was just unbelievable.

187
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,216
It's never been like that before.

188
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,850
Was it OK?

189
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,136
It was... different.

190
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,291
- Different?
- You make love like a Japanese meal -

191
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,777
small portions, but so many courses.

192
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,537
- Look, Nirvanah...
- We must dress and go now.

193
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,498
- Look, Nirvanah, what I'm trying to say...
- Please, don't say anything.

194
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,133
I hope you didn't get me wrong just then. That meant
nothing to me. Truly, less than nothing, really.

195
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,177
Good.

196
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,253
- We may as well have been playing tennis.
- As it should be.

197
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,493
I, er... don't suppose
you fancy a tie-break?

198
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,937
I'm sorry. I've got things I should do.

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,932
Niet problemski.

200
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,135
You know... we usually talk.

201
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,970
- What do you talk about?
- Oh, research,

202
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,575
new theories, mission profiles.

203
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,980
I'm sorry. I must have seemed very ignorant.

204
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,929
I hardly said anything apart from "Geronimo".

205
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,778
Thank you for the workout.

206
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,053
Dress.

207
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,813
Transmit.

208
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,171
Privacy off.

209
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,016
Commander, some amusing news. Stocky has
chosen you to meet our guest's challenge.

210
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,217
What you're suggesting is immoral
and illegal. Mind-patching is outlawed.

211
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,412
- But it IS possible?
- Possible but highly dangerous.

212
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,370
The side effects can be devastating. You
could be reduced to a gibbering simpleton.

213
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,338
Reduced?

214
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,329
I dont care, I'm prepared
to take the chance.

215
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:44,010
- Even if it costs your mind?
- It's a small price to pay.

216
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,770
Look, on that ship I can touch, I can feel, I can taste.

217
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,819
I'm not a half man anymore. With them I'm whole again.

218
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,618
Rimmer, they're a bunch of arrogant, pompous,
emotionally weird, stuck-up megalomaniacs.

219
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,533
Do you really think you're
going to fit in with them?

220
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,896
What am I saying? Bon voyage.

221
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,853
He's right, sir. Why would you
want to throw in with people like that?

222
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,612
To be somebody, I want to have a position
of authority on a scout ship exploring unchartered space,

223
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,093
work alongside educated men and women,
officers, people who count.

224
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,096
Lister, this is my one chance
to seize my dream, to be with the winners.

225
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,651
- Look at me. What do you see?
- Tell me.

226
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,492
You see a sad and lonely guy. A guy who left home
at 16 to become an officer and a gentleman

227
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,493
and ended up as a chicken
soup machine operative.

228
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,006
Is it any wonder my
father had four strokes?

229
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,417
Is it any wonder he used
to sit by the window and dribble?

230
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,571
I did that to him. Me.

231
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,410
Look, there's nothing wrong
with what you did. It was just a job.

232
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,136
- You ARE your job.
- Oh, not so, sir!

233
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,019
Now, was Albert Camus
a goalkeeper or a philosopher?

234
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,254
Was Albert Einstein an clerk in a patent office
or the greatest physicist who ever lived?

235
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,970
And, of course, there's the oft-told
tale of the simple carpenter's son

236
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,260
who went on to own the largest chain
of pizza stores in history, Harry Beedlebaum.

237
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,909
Kryten, Albert Einstein didn't
spend the best years of his life

238
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:12,899
picking out lumps of desiccated
poultry from the end of his nozzle cleaner.

239
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,971
That doesn't make you a failure.

240
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,219
It does in my parents' eyes.
It does in my brothers' eyes.

241
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,409
It does in the eyes of everyone WITH eyes.
That's exactly what it makes me.

242
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,453
Sir, I beg you to reconsider. If not for your sanity,

243
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,897
you haven't even considered
the moral implications of your decision.

244
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,940
You will be joining a society
where you will be compelled to have sex

245
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,094
with beautiful, brilliant women
twice daily on demand.

246
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,017
Now, am I really the only one here
who finds that just a little bit tacky?

247
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,574
Well, quite clearly I am.

248
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,898
Sir, I've uploaded the two candidates
to be inserted into your mind -

249
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,770
Science Officer Buchan,
excellent scientific background, 169 IQ,

250
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,299
and Flight Coordinator McQueen,
superlative mathematician, 172 IQ.

251
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,057
Now, even taking into account the enormous
drag factor of your own mind,

252
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,575
I still think we'll come up with something pretty special.

253
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,428
But I will still have control?

254
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:22,419
You'll have access to their knowledge, but
your personality will have the power of veto.

255
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,609
But, sir, I implore you to reconsider. If not for yourself, then for the poor officer whose life you will take.

256
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:33,213
Wasn't it St Francis of Assisi himself who said,
"Never give a sucker an even break"?

257
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,378
Well, if he did, sir,
it was strictly off the record.

258
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,814
- Come on, Kryten. Get on with it.
- Commencing integration.

259
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,813
Glory or insanity awaits.

260
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,010
- He's read every book in the medical library?
- In under three hours.

261
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,730
The change is quite astonishing.
But sir, I feel I should warn you -

262
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,451
this is not the pile of human wreckage
we know as Arnold Rimmer.

263
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,736
Prepare yourself.

264
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,656
Sir, we've received the co-ordinates.
Perhaps we should be... making tracks?

265
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,020
Kry-ten.

266
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,877
I was just thinking. Assuming, of course,
we're not dealing with five-dimensional objects

267
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:16,668
in a basic Euclidean geometric
universe and given the essential premise

268
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:20,264
that all geomathematics is based on the hideously
limiting notion that one plus one equals two

269
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:25,016
and not as Astermeyer correctly postulates that one and two
are in fact the same thing observed from different precepts...

270
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,978
(SNORTS)

271
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,895
..the theoretical shapes described by Sidis
must therefore be: a polydridocdecawihedron

272
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,132
a hexasexahedroadicon
and a dibidolihedecadodron.

273
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,813
(SNORTS)

274
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,575
- Everything else is poppycock, isn't that so?
- Rimmer?

275
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,056
I wrote a palindromic haiku this morning. Perhaps you'd like to hear it?

276
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,736
- I'm afraid we don't speak Japanese, sir.
- I could translate it into Mandarin for you?

277
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,652
Rimmer, we don't speak Japanese, we don't
speak Mandarin, and we don't speak satsuma.

278
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,289
He is really beginning to get on my pecs.

279
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,737
You must remember, sir, he's operating
on a completely different level to us now.

280
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,820
To him, we are the intellectual equivalent
of domestic science teachers.

281
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,490
Subject ready for transfer.

282
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,618
Farewell, gentlemen. Glory awaits.

283
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,324
Attention candidates, to preserve the
pure intellectual nature of this challenge

284
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,974
you will remain
in separate suites.

285
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,458
The questions will come through your headphones in a variety
of different languages to confuse and disorient you.

286
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,096
There will be a total of 200,000 questions
in this initial session.

287
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,851
After you have completed the tasks
at workstation A you may proceed to workstation B.

288
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,530
I shall undertake both tasks
simultaneously, if it's all the same to you.

289
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,620
- Mr Rimmer, that is impossible.
- Nevertheless, I shall attempt it.

290
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,211
It begins.

291
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,819
(BLEEPING AND TAPPING)

292
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,651
Erm, you sound like exactly what we're looking for.
Are there any questions that you would like to ask us?

293
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,630
I just want to get one
thing clear in my mind.

294
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:25,525
This is an opportunity to be revived as
a hologram and become a part of the crew...

295
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,175
...and the crew is you three?

296
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,978
Basically, you spend your time salvaging derelict
spaceships, playing poker and eating curries.

297
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,620
- We don't do that much salvaging.
- But you do sound like you eat a lot of curries.

298
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,056
We don't eat curry every night, if that's what you think.

299
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,340
In fact, I remember quite clearly last June,
Mr Lister had a pizza. Remember?

300
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,298
- Yeah.
- And you didn't like it.

301
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,419
But then I poured curry sauce over it,
and he yummed it up.

302
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,329
And the all-night poker sessions,
is it always strip poker?

303
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,057
- It depends on how drunk we are.
- Or how much curry he's had.

304
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,059
So - and this is probably sounds like a stupid question -

305
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,531
you don't really have much interest
in horse riding or ballet?

306
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,450
Fine by us, yeah. As long as we can have
a curry afterwards, we're cool.

307
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,214
Of course, there's one or two
other people that we have to see,

308
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,135
but, in theory, if we offered you the post
of replacement hologram would you accept?

309
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,900
- No.
- No.

310
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,412
- No, I think I'm better off where I am.
- But you're dead!

311
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,694
And meeting you guys has really made me
appreciate it a whole lot more.

312
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,971
Well, thank you, Ms Harrison.

313
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,700
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Next.

314
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,858
Next candidate, Deck Sergeant Sam Murray.

315
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,012
Ah, Sam. Now, as Holly will have told you...

316
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,894
- My own mind's come back! You gotta help me.
- Well, what happened exactly?

317
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,769
Was it a slow deterioration in your own
intelligence or did it happen in seconds?

318
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,251
Seconds. I'm in the middle of the assessment, you've got to give me another mind-patch, pronto.

319
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,659
I'm sorry, sir. It's classic
rejection syndrome.

320
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,449
Once the minds are unmeshed,
there is nothing we can do.

321
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,232
What are you talking about?

322
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:05,696
You just don't have the sort of
brain that can accept an implant, sir.

323
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,050
- No!
- I'm sorry, sir.

324
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,570
- There must be something you can do?
- I'm afraid not.

325
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,499
But I'm winning, I'm so close... Who's this?

326
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,329
I'm not even gone and you're choosing my replacement!

327
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,454
- We thought you weren't coming back.
- Well, you should've known better, shouldn't you?

328
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,410
You actually expect something to go right
for me? Arnold "Schmucko" Rimmer?

329
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,493
Tosspot by Royal Appointment?

330
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,775
Well, where are you going, sir?

331
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,376
I'm going to withdraw.

332
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,540
I hear you're doing well in the assessment.

333
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,771
(MUTTERS SNIDELY)

334
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,213
Well, listen, if you make it through
maybe you'd like to have sex sometime next week?

335
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,819
- I'm free Wednesday morning.
- I'm sorry, I'm busy Wednesday. I'm killing myself.

336
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,770
(LIFT) Floor 6120 - botanical gardens.

337
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,057
Arnie, where've you been?

338
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,251
To hell and back.

339
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,054
- I've withdrawn from the challenge.
- But you're winning.

340
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,855
- I was using a mind-patch.
- A mind-patch? Are you insane?!

341
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:21,050
I would've done anything to get on this ship.
Every time I look in the mirror, I see this.

342
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,214
Only to me, it doesn't mean hologram,
it means "halfwit",

343
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,259
"hopeless", "hideous failure".

344
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,617
This was a chance to be somebody.
Somebody I liked.

345
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,096
I've never met anyone like you before.

346
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,213
- Everyone says that.
- Listen to me, mister.

347
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,577
Underneath all that neurotic mess
is someone nice trying to get out.

348
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,340
someone who deserves a chance to grow.

349
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,731
So you won't give up, OK?

350
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,370
- OK?
- I cheated.

351
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,290
You're going to win, Arnie.
You're going to get your dream. I promise you.

352
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,576
You really think?

353
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,369
I really think.

354
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,539
- I won.
- What?!

355
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,013
My opponent withdrew. I won.
I'm an officer. I leave tonight.

356
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,656
Look, I'm not good at big speeches,

357
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,819
and I know I haven't always
been an easy guy to get on with.

358
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,690
And I know that, given the choice, I probably wouldn't
have chosen you as friends.

359
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,053
But I just want to say that over the years,

360
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:53,013
I have come to regard you
as... people... I met.

361
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,978
- I'd just better go, OK?
- See you, smeghead.

362
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,938
- Transfer.
- Transfer.

363
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,494
Here are your quarters, Mr Rimmer.

364
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,175
There must be some mistake, these
are Commander Crane's quarters.

365
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,259
Oh, didn't you know? She was your opponent.

366
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,251
Navigation Officer Rimmer reporting, sir.

367
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,090
Arnold, welcome aboard.
I trust everything's to your sa-

368
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,098
Permission to speak, sir.

369
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,133
I wish to resign my commission, sir.

370
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,578
Resign. May I ask your reasoning, please?

371
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,455
Flight Commander Crane has taken leave of
her senses and fallen in love with me, sir.

372
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,306
Love? (SCOFFS) Surely not.

373
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,293
Commander Crane is far too intellectually advanced
to submit to a mere short-term hormonal imbalance.

374
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,458
That's why she withdrew from the
challenge and allowed me to win, sir.

375
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,019
Mr Rimmer, what you are suggesting is that somehow she cared more for your happiness than she did for her own life.

376
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,418
Am I? Yes, sir. I suppose I am, sir.

377
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,170
And now you are doing something equally unfathomable,
resigning so that she can be reinstated,

378
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,411
even though here, you could have everything -

379
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,978
a position of command,
an effective physical presence, everything.

380
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,815
Perhaps you'd be kind enough
to pass this note on to her, sir.

381
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,217
I understand your gesture, but your
really your resignation solves nothing.

382
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,894
After all, the two of you will still be... apart.

383
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,775
- Permission to return to Red Dwarf, sir.
- Granted.

384
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,009
Oh, and, sir, you're wrong.

385
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,492
We won't be apart,
we just... won't be together.

386
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,971
I cannot believe I just said that.

387
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,891
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

388
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,337
# I'm all alone, more or less

389
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,618
# Let me fly far away from here

390
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,454
# Fun, fun, fun

391
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,136
# In the sun, sun, sun

392
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,531
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

393
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,852
# Drinking fresh mango juice

394
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,251
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

395
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,060
# Fun, fun, fun

396
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,770
# In the sun, sun, sun

397
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,659
# Fun, fun, fun

398
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,291
# In the sun, sun, sun #
